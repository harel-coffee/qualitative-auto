Copyright (c) 2006 Nitin Madnani, nmadnani@umiacs.umd.edu

Description:
- This package contains files to generate Perl and Python wrappers for an SRILM language model [1].

Requirements:
 - GNU make
 - Simplified Wrapper & Interface Generator (SWIG) [2]
 - A local Python and/or Perl installation
 - The SRI language modeling toolkit

Installation:
 (1) Modify the following environment variables at the top of the included Makefile:
    - SRILM_LIBS : The directory containing the SRILM libraries
    - SRILM_INC  : The directory containing the SRILM header files
    - PYTHON_INC : The directory containing the python header files
    - PERL_INC   : The directory containing the perl header files

 (2) To create a Python module, run 'make python' in this directory. Copy '_srilm.so' and 'srilm.py' to your directory where you want to use the python module. You can run the included 'test.py' script to check whether the compiled module works correctly. The output of test.py should be the following numbers in order:

32
42
1
-1.3822170496
-1.23044896126
-0.176091298461
-4.79909944534


 (3) To create a Perl module, run 'make perl' in this directory. Copy 'srilm.so' and 'srilm.pm' to the directory of your choice. Run the included Perl script 'test.pl' to test whether the compiled module works correctly. The output should be:

32
42
1
-1.38221704959869
-1.23044896125793
-0.17609129846096
-4.79909944534302

Usage:
- Usage is clearly illustrated in files 'test.pl' and 'test.py' included in this package.
