1. Since we are going to provide annotation on each sentence for every system, we assume that there will be a unique sentence ID, where the different system translations will be pointing to. 

2. In the attached file, please see an example originated from a German to Polish system. Here, we are providing
(a) the highly scored sentence, as a flat string
(b) an n-best list of hierarchical phrases (trees).
- Each hypothesis provides a set of Joshua scores as attributes. Total scoring is given by "scoring" 
- Each node of the tree represents a non-terminal, which has a class name (ROOT, S or X). The alignment information in the "from" and "to" arguments. Each non-terminal can contain other non-terminals or text.
- Unknown words are included into the <OOV> tag. 

3. Please also find attached a part of the visualized derivation tree (from a German to English) with corresponding German source sentence and English reference. The complete graph is too big, so most of the source side tree (white), which is symmetric to the target tree (red), is excluded. We hope this helps the understanding of the representation.
