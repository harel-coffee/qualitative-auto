Our charter of the basic rights is the first in this millennium.
We must succeed in forming the union of the Fifteen of them so that we can receive the countries which knock at our door under adequate conditions.
In article 87 the <A[field|area]> of the services for the public for social, cultural and charitable interests must be picked up with so that these important <A[facilities|institutions]> can be protected also permanently.
Some think that one can <A[get|create]> a home market into Europe without being agreed over basic values and principles to oneself.
I would like to welcome also the clear and substantial <M[speech contribution]> of president <U[Prodi]> for my part.
How you know, if one decided in Amsterdam consciously for separating these two functions from each other clearly. The High Representative is not expressed - in the contrast to the commission - completely independently, but <A[his|its]> task <A[consists|exists]> in the coordination of the exterior and <A[security|safety]> politics which fall into the responsibility of the member states, and here we must arrange certainly a bigger place to the <M[government cooperation]>.
He expressed the wish that the premiership shows the future way in Nice.
One can want in fact a more comprehensive and better result, nevertheless am <U[offengestanden]> I the opinion that we did a good beginning.
Therefore I hope for the European <A[Council|Advice]> agreeing to this <A[intention|plan]> in Nice and deciding it <A[concrete|actual]> than <A[intentions|plans]>, not as <U[fait accompli]>, onto the way to bring, natural after the now necessary reforms were concluded.
I referred, however, to our being able to reach extremely important <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]> with the shared method in the present reality also actually, as for example now a more effective procedure on the Balkans.
Only if we tie Russia to the west and to the European Union, we will be able to take also influence onto <A[his|its]> <A[politics|policy]> and stay with Russia in contact and in the conversation.
<M[Resolution <A[request|application]>]> (B5-0767 / 00) of Mr <U[Napolitano]> in the name of the committee for constitutional questions to the charter of the basic rights of the European Union
He puts this genocide currently away and in addition attempts completely to remove <M[media freedom]> and rule of law in Russia that anyhow hardly exists.
In the aim to be raked to the expectations of this pensioner that is called <U[Giuseppe Italia]>, lives in <U[Cremona]> and would use the bottom by ship gladly I voted for the report <U[Piecyk]>, that the expansion and the <A[development|evolution]> the Lake- and inland ports' as well as the intermodal terminals' affects.
The <A[objective|destination|purpose]> of the guideline which was recognized by all speakers and the commission and approved is made inaccessible by the voting result of the High House.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, I have, as I already during the pronunciation, therefore before the vote, clear has done, tuned for the report <U[Skinner]> because I regard venture capital as very important.
My <M[<A[faction|fraction]> colleague]> <U[Armonia Bordes]> explained yesterday unmistakably, that only a minority on that is from, to use <M[community money]> and <M[annuity contract contributions]> to the cover of <M[entrepreneur risks]>.
Subsequently the charter is <A[rather|earlier]> used for confirming the current, even <U[rückschrittlichen]> practices of the <M[national states]> than that <A[it|she]> represents a real <A[progress|headway]>.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, <A[at last|finally]> a charter of the basic rights of the <M[union citizen]> lies on the table in which a whole article, that is article 25, is dedicated to the older citizens.
Nevertheless if he received legally binding effect and was taken over into the contract, as this the European Parliament demands, it would lead inevitably to a unification of the national right of the <A[single|individual]> European countries with the time. <A[It|He]> would cause that the court of justice would receive a disproportionately great power, that the centralization would be intensified around the European institutions and the independent <M[deciding match <A[room|space]>]> of every nation would be restricted.
· A <U[Überfrachtung]> of the charter with <M[detailed <A[regulations|arrangements]>]> should keep on being put down and being reserved these the subordinate right.
I will vote for another charter in my participating in the demonstrations at the 13th and 14th October in <U[Biarritz]> and on the 7th December 2000 in Nice.
<A[Progress|Headway]> of the 12 <M[<A[applicant|candidate]> countries]> on the way for the <A[entry|joining]>
I <A[think|mean]> to put through the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> in the necessary period that a series of member states did not understand it until today yet that there is this <A[connection|context]> and that the hesitant getting on of the <M[government conference]> can bring us into great difficulties.
We will only be able to put through all this which I talked about up to now in the long run, when in the <M[<A[entry|joining]> <A[candidate|nominee]> countries]> as well as also in the European Union the <A[politics|policy]> and the elites - and in this restricted <A[connection|context]> I give to you right, Mr <U[Kommissar]> - <A[at last|finally]> to advertise the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> being to the European Union for them even usefully.
This is the universal principle.
<A[Make|Let]> me come to the second <A[aim|objective]> with which the premiership wants to <U[voranbringen]> the <M[<A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> <A[process|trial]>]> in this half-year now.
I suggest therefore to you to work in this direction with the <A[idea|presentation]> that we must check in the regard for 2003 which <A[candidates|nominees]> are ready to follow us for this date.
I thank the reporter of the committee for <A[his|its]> comprehensive and clear report for foreign affairs, Mr <U[Brok]>.
It does not go around in any only case in the negotiations this "whether", it only goes around this "as" and "when".
But they did it also therefore because the hope for the solidarity of the European nations gives them the perspectives of the <A[membership|affiliation]> in the European Union and because so <A[firm|fixed|steady]> political and economic anchoring is offered to them.
A series of countries got on also <A[with|in the case of]> the second economic criterion of the competitive capacity on the home market so well that they come closer <A[speedily|uninterruptedly]> to the <M[<A[entry|joining]> <A[maturity|ripeness]>]>.
We search therefore the most closely possible coordination with the programs of the national governments, the parliament and other institutions.
Annual - and that is soon, on the 8th November, renewed the case - the judgment of the commission on the <A[progress|headway]> achieved by them is expected in each of the <A[entry|joining]>-willing countries with very <A[great|large]> tension.
To right we decided for the basic principle of the differentiation according to which every <M[<A[entry|joining]> <A[candidate|nominee]> country]> is evaluated according to <A[his|its]> <A[progress|headway]> and services.
This debate is a further occasion for my <A[faction|fraction]>, to <A[confirm|strengthen]>, that the <A[entry|joining]> the <A[means|average]> and east-European state, but also Cyprus and Malta, that best <M[future protection]> is for us all in Europe in the east and in the west.
This is a matter of greatest <A[importance|meaning]> hardly to find, however, observation in public.
Many think jocularly that <A[according to|after]> the case of the Berlin wall the time stayed up to the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> always now: five years.
The next <A[natural|unaffected]> occasion is offered in the <A[connection|context]> with the following <A[choices|elections]> to the European parliament in the year 2009, but we want to make an effort for many countries being able to join if possible in already 2004.
In the remaining one there are six contents-related aspects to which we have objections because of the used method.
In reality the chosen model of the European agreement itself that leads to this <A[dead end|cul-de-sac]>, that is the simultaneous inclusion of all sectors is it independent of the traditions and special features of the <A[participants|people involved]>.
" to this in central and east Europe at the end of the eighties almost generally articulated feeling figure to lend, an <A[obligation|commitment]> represents for us all up to the present day.
However, in order to call the things clear <A[with|in the case of]> the name: There can not be any <A[entries|joinings]> for the <M[cheap rate]>.
It is a great and simultaneously beautiful <A[idea|presentation]>, that we do not carry out the <A[enlargements|expansions|extensions]> against the public and that the best manner, to carry out the <A[enlargements|expansions|extensions]> in agreement with the public, <A[consists|exists]> in <A[their|her]> <A[participation|share]> at the <A[choices|elections]>, because the <A[choices|elections]> are expression of the democracy and a form of the inclusion of the citizens in the political system.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, my very admired ladies and gentlemen! I would like to say shortly something with regard to the assumptions for a scenario which was wanted here from several <A[pages|sides]>.
I would be very surprised if they did not do any pressure.
But I had referred already to all countries of the <M[<A[entry|joining]> <A[maturity|ripeness]>]> approaching relatively quickly.
That is, the <M[commercial liberalization]> in the <A[field|area]> of the farm products is really already fixed without the Poles having the worry that therefore the Polish agriculture collapses.
There were also loads, but in the Large and Whole one peace and <A[trade|commerce]> familiarized each other with the citizens and citizens of the <M[union countries]>. The monetary union keeps on intensifying this <A[development|evolution]>.
The <M[negotiation results]> should be decisive.
The only amendment which up to now was presented is already contained in my report, but I am pleased with the <A[faction|fraction]> of the <A[greens|Green Party]> underlining the <A[importance|meaning]> of the <M[same <A[treatment|handling|processing]>]> of the citizens and citizens.
For this purpose only a law does not belong to the public service, but also, that there are chances and an adequate payment for the young administrative assistants.
That is valid both for Latvia and for the European Union!
The <A[connection|accessibility|link]> of the litas at the euro is planned in the second half of the year 2001.
. (IT) Mr <U[Präsident]>, Mr <U[Kommissar]>! Poland, for which I am the reporter, is the largest and most important, nevertheless how we know at the same time also the most problematic of the countries that prepare themselves for the <A[entry|joining]> to the European Union; such an abundance of problems that there are even rumors about a possible exclusion of Poland from the first group, that is the group of the countries joining first, shows.
How did too many promises that we did not hold give to <A[poles|terminals]> and to the eastern, formerly communist countries.
A point remains which again and again emerges if it is a question of Czechia. That is the problem of the <U[Roma]>.
The Slovakia was not referred into the second group, and in the correct sequence she would like to join simultaneously with Czechia.
An only remark on the <M[inside <A[politics|policy]>]> is definitive to me at the same time still allows.
Thirdly, what concerns the agriculture whose <M[productivity level]> still lies under that of the European Union, so it will be necessary, the agricultural market complete for that for the denationalization of <A[reason|bottom|ground]> and <A[ground|bottom]>, modernization of the agricultural <A[companies|operations]> and the <M[marketing structures]> as well as necessary to the increase of the <A[profits|yields]> capital open.
Bulgaria is due very a lot to an <A[entry|joining]> to the European Union and to the NATO.
The acute poverty is since 1990 one of the most serious problems of Romania, nevertheless it emerges under the present government that in fact the economical situation turns to the better one.
These topics will become it is to be hoped priority of the new parliament constituting in 14 days and the Slovenian government.
Is to be underlined, however, that a final just and <A[durable|permanent]> solution both the relevant resolutions of the <M[<U[UN]> Security Council]>, that is nothing else than the valid international law, as soon as the basic principles, the European Union underlying, must consider.
Malta in addition has stable, functioning democratic institutions.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, Mr <U[Kommissar]>, worth colleagues and colleagues! In the name of the committee for economy and <M[currency questions]> also we would like to contribute our part to this pronunciation.
You must also be moved. The European <M[community right]> is now not only a <U[law]> in <U[the books]>, but must be also in the <M[<A[entry|joining]> states]> a <U[law]> in <U[action]>.
This change makes hard <A[requirements|requests]> on the people in the <M[<A[applicant|candidate]> countries]>, safeguards, however, also simultaneously <A[their|her]> future and the future of <A[their|her]> children.
Special attention - and there I follow the <U[Vorredner]> - is to be put onto the <M[<A[border|boundary]> <A[regions|areas]>]>.
The commission must only not be let in this <A[connection|context]>!
The <A[entry|joining]>-willing countries strive for a rapid economic growth even if this <A[works|goes]> at the expense of an already defined <M[nature conservation <A[politics|policy]>]>.
It resulted in an <A[exchange|replacement]> of bad habits, so also in the <A[field|area]> of the health.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! The <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> is vital for the construction of a strong and united European continent.
The European Parliament and <A[his|its]> committee for regional policy that is responsible also for the <A[field|area]> of the traffic and the trans-European nets are conscious of the necessity, to coordinate the different sectorial <M[community politics]> for the benefit of a global <M[regional planning <A[politics|policy]>]>.
Before however another <A[tip|notice]> on the <M[traffic infrastructure]> of central <A[importance|meaning]> being for the success of the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]>.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, I follow those that see the greatest task of the <U[EU]> in the imminent <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]>.
In the former <M[plan economies]> of central and east Europe considerable pressure is exerted onto the traditional social values.
The <U[EVP]> would not like to take away the responsibility for the <M[<A[entry|joining]> speed]> from the <M[<A[candidate|nominee]> countries]>, because we can not fix any <M[<A[entry|joining]> date]>.
The second point is the mention of data.
There is still another <A[reason|bottom|ground]>.
Thirdly: The acceptance of the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> and <A[their|her]> positive perspectives for the <A[single|individual]> countries and for the <U[EU]> as a whole depend - that showed Denmark - in a <A[leading|substantially]> way on the social and democracy deficits of European <A[politics|policy]> being reduced.
Populism is the disparaging <A[denomination|expression]>, with the technocrats the <M[nation will]> to defame if it is shown in a manner that does not suit them.
My ladies and gentlemen, you have <A[food|Essen]> and <A[recovery|rest]> <A[pause|break]>! It goes on at 21.00 o'clock.
It becomes, when also in the long term, a common currency for the <A[entire|whole]> continent <A[are|give]>.
" over these questions are provoked internal quarrels in the <A[single|individual]> countries.
We call her for the fight for another Europe, a Europe of all nations which is released from these inhuman stigmata in which all nations can determine <A[their|her]> fate itself and make relationships of the peace, the freedom, the brotherliness and the cooperation to the <A[mutual|reciprocal]> benefit under each other.
I would like to acknowledge the <A[work|job]> of these organizations with that in public. Among that <A[number|count]> particularly also the <U[Romanian Challenge Appeal]> that has <A[his|its]> seat in Birmingham as well as organizations from Ireland that are supported by many people so also of the Irish <M[<A[conversation|entertainment]> artist]> <U[Daniel]> without '<U[Donnell]>, that commits <A[itself|himself]> to a donation at the level of 1 million pounds and this sum <A[gathered|compiled]> in Ireland and other parts of the world.
The peak in Nice must bring particularly <A[clearness|clarity]>, whether and as the <U[EU]> can move herself <A[for her part|for their part]> into the situation even comprehensively and in time to become expandable.
The Poles ask to themselves: They are paid then also to us if we have joined, or are we countries of second class?
I am, however, so <A[secure|sure]> that <A[with|in the case of]> good will and with the aid of the European Union a solution which makes a <A[harmonious|harmonic]> <A[coexistence|life]> and a life in prosperity for the two communities possible can be found as this lasting for centuries was the case.
We saw, however, also to the question of the minorities because the question of the integration of these minorities, also <A[their|her]> linguistic integration, in these countries is also important.
The assumptions for the <A[membership|affiliation]> is actually the fulfillment of the basic criteria of Copenhagen.
We heard a lot about the advantages of the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]>, however, that is a <A[field|area]> in which we can learn from Lithuania.
You introduce yourself, we would be all so!
Mr <U[Präsident]>, Mr <U[Kommissar]>! I would like to thank also gentlemen <U[Brok]> and the remaining reporters and they congratulate, but I would like to concentrate particularly on Slovakia, in particular onto the <M[minority <A[politics|policy]>]>.
I ask you to define a date in Nice until when you with the at the widest advanced <M[<A[candidate|nominee]> countries]> - without <M[name mention]> - intend to end the negotiations.
The European Union keeps on having to help Bulgaria into the union on <A[his|its]> way to the entry and cause of course that the planning of this <A[help|assistance]> in a still more decentralized way occurs.
The dialog between the <A[parties engaged in labor negotiations|parties to wage agreements]>, the other groups of the <M[<A[civil|civilian]> society]>, the government and the parliament plays in this case an important and - as we find - positive role.
Nevertheless we are <A[just|precisely]> at overcoming the division of Europe and not creating any new.
This all is contained in the report by baron's daughter <U[Nicholson of Winterbourne]>, and I thank her for this report very cordially in the name of our <A[faction|fraction]>.
According to this <A[sense|understanding]> Cyprus might absolutely be in my opinion the topic which will determine the ability of Europe to accept figure politically.
I myself live near the Baltic Sea that is a common matter for us all.
The political vision keeps on existing.
So we took the wish with special joy of <U[Klaus Hänsch]> for the knowledge which spoke for the <M[<U[PSE]>-<A[faction|fraction]>]> that the commission likes to give a real evaluation of the effects of the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> and also the economical consequences if it does not result in the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]>.
Nevertheless I divide the <A[opinion|view]> of our reporter, the colleague <U[Würmeling]>, that it will not <A[work|go]> without <M[temporary periods of time]> in the interest of both contracting parties, and <A[just|precisely]> as representatives of a <M[<A[border|boundary]> <A[region|area]>]> that has a farm so as the colleague <U[Schierhuber]> near the Czech <A[border|boundary]> a request is it to me that the origin of near common markets without greater problems can be overcome and leads to a positive result on both <A[pages|sides]>.
I want to underline three points as a social democrat.
The questions' of the first <A[pillar|pier]> containing <U[EWR]> give the economy in the <M[<A[applicant|candidate]> countries]> <A[access|entrance]> to the home market, the youth and science to juridical <M[<A[exchange|replacement]> programs]>, oblige the <U[EU]> on the other hand but not yet to expand <A[their|her]> system the <U[Agrarbeihilfen]> onto these countries. Thus positive impulses would take the <M[<U[EWR]> descendant]> as a basis, in particular for the economy in the <M[<A[applicant|candidate]> countries]> - they need growth in order to make <A[their|her]> <A[society|company]> fit for the <A[entry|joining]> - as also for the national economy in the <U[EU]>, if it is assessed that the costs of the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> form even two thirds <A[about|over]> the economic growth in the <M[<U[EWR]> model]> possibly even still more.
Secondly: you say goodbye to the <U[big]> anxiously ­ idea to receive many <M[<A[entry|joining]> <A[candidates|nominees]>]> simultaneously this would contradict the principle, to receive every country according to <A[his|its]> <A[progress|headway]>.
Thirdly: We must do everything in order to prepare the European Union for the <M[<A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> <A[process|trial]>]> to 2003 in the sense of the splendid speech of the <M[commission president]> <U[Prodi]>.
I want to speak to the <A[relation|proportion|relationship]> parliament / council in the <A[connection|context]> with the <A[tip|notice]>, that meanwhile there are considerable delays during the answer of written inquiries.
It makes dubious that this happens in a country which wants to join the European Union.
I apply for the <M[moving-transfer]> onto the committee in which the necessary steps are supposed to be prepared.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! Today we discuss in total three reports on this topic, two of me and maybe to vote on that.
That would affect on all <A[stages|steps]> of the <M[food chain]> favorably.
Secure food means costs in the <A[entire|whole]> chain.
We must agree therefore to Ms <U[Paulsen]> and the commission and record the <M[overlap <A[prohibition|ban]>]> so that the <M[animal <A[feed|fodder|lining]>]> becomes more secure and the European consumers are really protected.
The guideline of 1999 was well thought over, and <A[it|she]> can record also now already a success, because loads could be reduced provably.
Simply to approve a mixing then, however, is not the solution.
Very shortly, we must <A[insist|pass]> on the amendment 37 concerning the <M[dioxin problem]>.
In this point we are an opinion.
In which raw material in the result of that we acquire when European consumers keep on buying meat, milk and <A[their|her]> by-products that are not manufactured on the <A[international markets|world markets]> from by any means the fodders corresponding to threshold and <A[border|boundary]> values defined by the union, that is therefore in a system on the <A[international markets|world markets]>, where every <A[material|cloth]> or every <A[dressing|preparation]> can be mixed without obstruction before the products are imported in the field of the European Union.
Up to the second reading the commission should inform us of the planned procedures for the <M[risk evaluation]>.
On the other hand it would be of consequence if for example the amendments 39 and 40 were accepted since there would not be any possibility anymore for the member states then to intervene in the case of <U[neu entdeckten]> dangers quickly.
Consumer protection begins already at the <M[animal <A[feed|fodder|lining]>]>, <A[with|in the case of]> the <M[fodder contents <A[materials|cloths]>]>, the <U[Deklarierung]> and finally the official controls.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, very much admired colleagues and colleagues! The report of the colleague <U[Paulsen]> to the unwanted <A[materials|cloths]> in the pet food affects an important topic which is a highly controversial one as all important topics.
The discussion about the excellent report by Ms <U[Paulsen]> that there is for us today was strongly emotionally shaped in some points, and in the connection to the present pronunciation we must assume presumably <A[severe|austere]> indeed editions that quality can subsequently be changed by additions, however, being valid for the feed industry.
Each of these three <A[proposals|suggestions]> becomes both separately than contribute also in the common cooperation to the elimination of the most important shortcomings that stepped through the <M[dioxin crisis]> to light.
With amendment 33 the reexport of <M[fodder lots]> which do not suffice for the <A[requirements|requests]> of this guideline into the <M[export third country]> is supposed to be prevented.
The commission refuses the amendments 41, 42, 43 and 44 in which it is suggested the possibility of the dilution of contaminated <M[fodder initial products]> under certain conditions to be introduced again.
This should suffice faced with our promise, that we will get in the frame of the new <A[proposal|suggestion]> over the <A[equipment|institution]> of a <M[food authority]> a system for the rapid communication that will cover the <A[entire|whole]> food and fodder chain.
Mr <U[Kommissar Byrne]>! <A[With|In the case of]> this guideline <A[about|over]> the traffic with <M[mixed fodder <A[means|resources|funds]>]> our old problem, that is the question of the open declaration, conceals itself in the <A[reason|bottom|ground]>.
And that is already the profit of the present morning for me.
Because if we did that, if we transplanted that quickly here and we go also quickly through the <U[Mitentscheidungsverfahren]>, that is certainly a great profit, and I am <A[secure|sure]> that we will be very strong and agreed opposite the <A[council|advice]>.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, dear colleagues and colleagues! Also in future it can occur, at least it is not, however, to exclude that contaminated <M[initial products]> reach fodders.
The <M[<U[BSE]>-scandal]> was the worst, best known example.
As our reporter already said, it would be at the most reasonable if we had a label with open declaration on which the ingredients are listed.
I think, the professional qualification and the discernment of the members in the <M[agriculture committee]> as regards agriculture and thus also as regards <M[animal <A[feeding|nutrition]>]> stands out of the question, in the sense of a practical and practical solution that is supposed to be used by the affected <A[farmers|cages|pawns]> and consumers and understood.
So far the positive part.
I hold this for a legitimate right to information to which we must take into account.
In the name of my colleagues of the <M[<A[fishing|fishery]> committee]> and in my own name I ask you for sending woman to president, to the <A[members|relatives]> of the <A[victims|sacrifices]> and to the local authorities of Brittany as also of <U[Marín]>, <U[Galicien]>, from where most <A[victims|sacrifices]> come, the <A[interest|sympathy]> of the parliament.
(The parliament accepts the resolution. )
- Would anyone like to speak out against the <A[presentation|pattern|submission]> of this verbal amendment?
So the reporter explained us the state of affairs.
Most technical <A[proposals|suggestions]> earn our decisive support, as for example in the <A[field|area]> <M[food <A[security|safety]>]>, disconnection of the nuclear power plants of the first generation, environmental protection, abatement of the <M[social dumping]>, the vital <M[behavior codex]> for enterprises active in the east from the west and many things more. These tasks are gigantic and therefore absolute major.
Simultaneously considerable difficulties are to be mastered also furthermore, in particular in the <M[budget <A[field|area]>]>.
An <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> around 13 countries does not change only the geopolitical frame of the European Union, but <A[it|she]> changes also <A[their|her]> structure, since on the one hand the <M[total population]> will increase (+ 28 %), on the other hand, however, also the number this "<U[benachteiligten]>" Areas.
It is to be noticed in this case that in the <M[<A[entry|joining]> countries]> a competitive country and <A[feeding|nutrition]> economy will be due to <A[their|her]> high economic and social <A[weight|emphasis|importance]> for the successful transformation and restructuring <A[process|trial]> of decisive <A[importance|meaning]>.
In this <A[connection|context]> I would like to express the wish, that the far remote <A[regions|areas]> which six of seven still count from to the ten poorest of the <U[EU]>, <M[structure fund <A[means|resources|funds]>]> not only alone due to the <M[BIP criterion]>, but also due to geographical, demographic and particularly social indicators receive.
Since we refuse this Europe in the interest of the French, we can not agree to <A[his|its]> <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> around the countries and nations of the east which are released <A[first|only]> from the communist dictatorship <A[just|precisely]> and can not know yet into which <U[technokratische]> and totalitarian trap they will pad with this step with good conscience.
We would have been supposed to let it <A[with|in the case of]> the <M[country reports]> and <A[with|in the case of]> at most a short but concise resolution <U[bewenden]>.
The at the present time practised system of aids, subsidies and rates must be replaced by free trade and adaptation to the market.
The <A[importance|meaning]> and range of the problems that the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> with themselves brings does not take with the <U[Doppelzüngigkeit]> with which talks about that in the European Union.
To talk about the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> does not mean for me, to confirm the <A[affiliation|membership]> of some countries to Europe or not.
Our <M[neighbor country]> made an effort for the fulfillment of the <M[<A[entry|joining]> criteria]> purposefully during the last ten years.
Latvia has <A[his|its]> place in this house, not only, because <A[it|him]> <A[his|its]> <A[progress|headway]> in total considers the right on this "Confidence advanced money" one broaching, that is vital for a successful end of such negotiations, but particularly and in the first place, because it is in Europe at home.
My opinion's is <A[poles|terminals]> the state that earns our support and our engagement from all <M[<A[entry|joining]> <A[candidates|nominees]>]> at the <U[ehesten]> because without the extremely important initiatives of Poland the communism would not have been brought to case, and we would not be today here in order to handle this problem.
This is not valid possibly for the Polish population which <A[consists|exists]> of <M[euro sceptics]> still to a large extent in same manner.
I appeal to Prague, this sign, this request to pick up this request around dialog that to correspond and together with this house to guarantee for this heritage of a nationalist era being able to be overcome.
. (<U[EN]>) <U[Ich]> welcomes the report by Mr <U[Wiersma]> <A[about|over]> the <A[request|application]> of Slovakia for <A[entry|joining]> to the European Union and can support the <A[biggest|greatest]> part of <A[his|its]> conclusions.
With great joy <U[entbiete]> I on this occasion the older citizens and the pensioners of the republic of Bulgaria my special greeting.
If Romania does <A[progress|headway]> also furthermore and the European Union has adapted <A[their|her]> institutional structures and politics in order to be able to overcome the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]>, I do not see any <A[reason|bottom|ground]>, for which Romania should not be received into the union.
The position represented in the report is <A[unequivocally|unambiguously]> too hard as ever a solution for the problem of the colonizers that is extremely difficult for both <A[pages|sides]> just the same as the <M[country return]> <A[could|might]> look.
Some of the <A[statements|testimonies]> that are contained into <A[security|safety]>, common to the <M[report draft]> of the committee for foreign affairs, human rights, and <M[defense <A[politics|policy]>]> <A[about|over]> the <A[request|application]> of the Republic of Cyprus on <A[entry|joining]> to the European Union are not more <U[Leider]> <A[just|precisely]> helpful.
Faced with the missing good will the Turkish-Cypriot ethnic group and this is to the Turkey no slight task.
Tell <U[Stenzel]> (A5-0243 / 2000)
I was <U[leider]> <A[victims'|sacrifices']> of one, when also easy, food poisoning that I had incurred <U[fatalerweise]> in the European Parliament.
For all these reasons I voted for the <M[overlap <A[prohibition|ban]>]> suggested by the European Commission.
We must ask the <M[<U[ASEM]>-countries]> in this <M[resolution <A[request|application]>]> to exert pressure on the <M[military regime]> in Burma so that the democracy is restored there.
We are not <A[consistent|logical]> in our <A[approach|procedure]> and during the <A[conversion|transfer]> of our measures.
Now the time is not for faintheartedness and despondency.
Some important points in the <A[regulation|arrangement]> are firstly: <A[Regulation|Arrangement]> of the burden of proof.
<M[Same <A[treatment|handling|processing]>]> and non-discrimination are basic principles of the <U[EU]>.
"This therefore the reasons for reason we need legal <A[regulations|arrangements]> to the abatement of the discrimination are.
There are now numerous compartment-juridical amendments for us also due to that, through which a same <M[protection level]> <A[in front of|before]> discrimination for reasons of the race on the one hand and for reasons of the religion, a hindrance, the age or the sexual direction on the other hand is supposed to be guaranteed.
<A[It|He]> had to be called in for balance, consideration and a good <M[right <A[technique|technology]>]>, and <A[his|its]> report reflects in my opinion these qualities.
In addition these members think that the discrimination is not so frequent that specific <M[right rules]> would have to be issued.
The financial equipment of the scheme does not suffice in order to replace the <A[work|job]> which is achieved in the Fifth <A[General-Purpose Program|Skeleton Program]> and continued it is to be hoped also in other <A[general-purpose programs|skeleton programs]>. Our task is to guarantee it, that <A[over|beyond]> the <M[program <A[borders|boundaries]>]> is cooperated.
<A[About|Over]> the necessity to combat discriminations general indeed <A[correspondence|agreement]> exists, <A[over|above|about]> which as, in which measure and with which <A[means|resources|funds]> the opinions go out, however.
In the committee I had the occasion to defend oneself against also experts that do not belong to any <U[NRO]> being able to manage to put a word in.
In the same way we welcome in high measure the <M[guideline <A[definition|purpose]>]> <A[according to|after]> which <M[same <A[treatment|handling|processing]>]> means also for disabled persons that corresponding adaptations are presupposed at the job through the enterprises.
Only so let's manage to combat discriminations effectively in all <A[fields|areas]> of the human <A[coexistence|life]> in Europe.
All in all also the great Anglo-Saxon democracies teach us that racism and discrimination with the aid of the liberal democracy, and not through the <A[limitation|restriction]> and gradual softening of the freedom of speech, the freedom of the <M[opinion comment]>, the <M[union freedom]> and the economical freedoms, are opposed.
In a <A[proposal|suggestion]> the equalization of the homosexuality with the holy <A[marriage|married state]> is demanded.
In this <A[way|manner]> the European Union can take a more <A[unequivocal|unambiguous]> attitude in <A[concrete|actual]> cases in which it is a question of the discrimination or the <M[same <A[treatment|handling|processing]>]> of <A[their|her]> citizens.
I would like to pay attention also to the question of the exception with respect to the religion.
From different <A[pages|sides]> objections were expressed <A[about|over]> the potential interpretation of the reason in which sexual direction and sexual behavior are differentiated between, however, to article 1 that something is still unclear.
In this <A[way|manner]> a hierarchy of the discrimination develops.
In New Caledonia one comes due to the color of the skin into the <A[pleasure|consumption]> of advantages.
Together with the guideline recently said goodbye 2000 this direction of the guideline proves the declared will of the European Union, to vouch for an open <A[society|company]> that is free from <M[thinking-stencils]> and particularly from the stigma of the racism in the European <A[history|story]> deeply rooted.
Those ones therefore, that declare here in this parliament the values that we all want to defend did not need to be stipulated in a European guideline are in the error.
These successes in a hard way <A[elaborated|acquired]> must not be infringed on.
Finally an important role is attributed also to the media during this task.
The experience also showed us, that the promotion of legislative <A[proposals|suggestions]> for the abatement of the discrimination is indispensable, however not sufficing.
We must prevent a senseless bureaucratic jumble, through Europe only onto a community materialistic in that, politically correct without deeper sense would be reduced.
This parliament embellished the actually too <U[derückhaltende]> <M[right regulation]> that the European Commission wanted to suggest to a Christmas tree my opinion.
<A[Make|Let]> me be thanked first of all to the two reporters, Mr <U[Mann]> and Mr <U[Cashman]>, for two excellent reports.
I can accept your amendments <A[further|distant]>, through which ones both the <A[importance|meaning]> of the prevention and the abatement of the discrimination is supposed to be underlined.
The second category is aimed at explaining the text of the <A[proposal|suggestion]> of the commission with regard to the contents while the third category is <A[consisting|existing]> of numerous amendments with which this <A[proposal|suggestion]> is supposed to be brought in accordance with the guideline adopted in the June of last year against <M[race discrimination]>.
In particular in the amendments 9, 10 and 20 it is suggested to delete the <A[tip|notice]> onto the discrimination due to the race and the ethnic origin.
I can not approve of your references in the amendments 21 and 45 to <A[natural|unaffected]> and juridical persons and not formalized groups of persons since this <A[proposal|suggestion]> is valid <A[about|over]> the <A[employment|activity|occupation]> only for individuals.
The vote occurs tomorrow at 12.00 o'clock.
We can not expect any public support for peace-creating <A[actions|insertions]> that we ourselves supplied if our troops with the <A[arms|weapons]> are threatened.
In my native country I could not buy even a shotgun without permission while I was not needing any permission for the <A[opening|inauguration]> of an <M[<A[arm|weapon]> <A[trade|commerce]>]> in my <M[garden shed]>.
A further important point is the <A[prohibition|ban]> of the export, sales promotion and marketing of pieces of equipment or of know-how which in the first place is used for purposes of the torture.
After these preliminary notes I would like to congratulate the reporter, colleague <U[Titley]>, on <A[his|its]> excellent report as a matter of course.
Next to the questions of the <A[obligation|courtesy|liability]> we must extend our consideration to one also onto emphases that are aimed immediately at a military <A[use|commitment|insertion]>, on disarmament, conversion, intensification of the activity of the police and customs organs, and to the other one onto the <M[<A[candidate|nominee]> countries]> spoken to <A[just|precisely]> by colleague <U[Wiersma]>.
If the circulation of money was controlled, it would be so considerably more difficult to avoid the regulations being valid for the <M[<A[arm|weapon]> <A[trade|commerce]>]>.
The <A[objective|destination|purpose]> of the annual inspection consists in determining such potential improvements.
The European Union currently checks, whether this project also <A[about|over]> the <M[project duration]> out, that ends in the November of this year, can be continued.
A <A[methodology|methodics]> and indicators were defined, that become on the next one Rat "Forschung" imagine.
I thank you, Mr <U[Busquin]>.
Concerning the problems of the <U[KMU]> we paid attention of course, that the <U[KMU]>, planned as in the <M[budget decision]>, to be considered in the <A[general-purpose program|skeleton program]> duly.
This seems to crystallize out of the debate at least <A[about|over]> the budget in Greece, and many refer in this case even to the attitude of the European Union.
What affects the <U[multidisziplinären]> character, so I divide your objections.
The first point which he mentioned expressly in <A[his|its]> <A[declaration|explanation]> is the <A[participation|share]> of the <U[EU]> in national programs.
We could not speak therefore of a European <M[research <A[room|space]>]> if we finance only 5 % of the <M[research budget]>.
<A[Many thanks|Thanks a lot]>, Mr <U[Busquin]>.
On the one hand the number of the <A[requests|applications]> standing for the decision for the financing was low due to the efforts completely to tie the <A[means|resources|funds]> up to the end of the year 1999 at the beginning of this financial year according to new <A[intentions|plans]>.
However, I would like to refer once again to Portugal fulfilling all for our contentment in the preceded period.
Inquiry no. 2 of (<U[H-0730]> / 00):
The <A[determination|definition]> of the <M[mineral oil steering wheels]> on a high level finally has not for the consequence, that the shared <M[competition rules]> are not kept to.
Secondly Following will be known to gentlemen <U[MacCormick]>: The member states with tax <A[means|resources|funds]> favor a certain industry sector, they hurt the regulations <A[about|over]> state aids, and tax indeed in this case aids, the subsidies in <A[about|for instance]> amount.
A very clear case is for example the nuclear energy.
Affects: <M[Budget line]> <M[minority languages]> That since 1983 existing budget <A[means|average]> the European Union for the benefit of <M[minority languages]> experienced to 1995 a <A[constant|steady]> increase and reached in the year <A[their|her]> highest level with 4 million euros.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! The colleagues in the parliament know certainly that the <M[structure grounds]> - and that is new - show many <A[means|resources|funds]> for cultural activities because I put <U[Barnier]> value on the <M[structure grounds]> not investing only in streets and in airports together with <U[Michel]> but also into the people.
Therefore the commission comes in in next year no further financial <A[obligations|commitments]>.
What affects <A[concrete|actual]> <A[proposals|suggestions]> for a financing, so I can not take any position at this place for this purpose since we must accept the usual linear path.
I took different possibilities into consideration.
And that is valid to prevent it, because we speak here of millions of small and middle enterprises in whole Europe.
Do the rules <A[about|over]> the hunt, for example the <M[elk hunt]>, affect also the <A[treatment|handling|processing]> of the meat specific for the own consumption?
If one would use the <A[regulations|arrangements]> for meat of animals hunted for the internal consumption, that meant a bureaucratic disaster so for the <M[elk hunt]>.
On completion of this report I intend to present <A[proposals|suggestions]> for the improvement of the livestock transports. In this case I will pay attention also to the problem of the inadequate enforcement of the <M[<A[move time|transport time]> restrictions]>.
We discussed this question before on my meeting with the <A[faction|fraction]> of the <A[greens|Green Party]>.
Our question was <A[unequivocal|unambiguous]>: which measures does the commission take?
The general product safety obliges also the manufacturers to clear up <A[their|her]> customers <A[about|over]> possible risks.
The case <U[Maryam Ayubi]> is being.
Inquiry no. 14 of (<U[H-0745]> / 00):
The <A[attitude|setting]> of the <U[EU]> with respect to this meeting towards <M[ministerial level]> in Vientiane, <A[natural|unaffected]> will be also opposite the question whether actually it should occur and/or on which level the <U[EU]> should be represented dependent on the <A[developments|evolutions]> in Burma up to December.
A last remark.
The <A[choices|elections]> are an important step during the inclusion of the inhabitants of Kosovo in the organization of <A[their|her]> communes.
I can assure you these <A[choices|elections]> were carried out more democratically and better than <A[choices|elections]> in our countries in which I either participated frequently or near which I was present as an observer.
However, we saw <A[it|him]> as a beginning and under no circumstances as an end of the <A[process|trial]>.
In that a more efficient and more coherent control of the <M[<A[arm|weapon]> <A[trade|commerce]>]> as well as a greater transparency are approved.
Now I state that every year more supply contracts are closed for <A[arms|weapons]> and accessories.
By means of fictitious information from virtual realities we can not make any pertinent decisions.
The <A[regulation|arrangement]>, at which these activities of one and that of the same <M[general <A[management|head office]>]> were carried out, should be checked.
These organs must have indeed the possibility to employ an internal accountant, turning the <M[finance controller]> certain minimum standards into the edition with regard to the audit would absolutely suffice, however.
This <A[proposal|suggestion]> how the Mr <U[Kommissar]> knows very well does not <A[meet|bump]> unanimous approval in the parliament.
Therefore - nothing against an independent, internal <M[audit service]> for which we give green light today with the report of the colleague <U[van Hulten]>!
Mr <U[Präsident]>, woman commissioner! First of all I would like to congratulate the reporter.
We think that the modernization of the administration is urgently necessary.
An independent <U[Gegenprüfung]> is vital in order to avoid <A[errors|mistakes]>.
The money is supposed to be spent in future more purposefully and more effectively, and of course it is supposed to be also better guaranteed that the <A[means|resources|funds]> also for the purposes are distributed for which they were determined by the <M[budget authority]>.
Following now for the suggested changes shortly: The commission agrees to the introduction of this additional <M[consideration <A[reason|bottom|ground]>]>.
I would like to thank therefore for your <A[proposals|suggestions]> and your <A[consultation|discussion]>.
I would like the <A[proposals|suggestions]> of this report, that my opinion's at the most important and at the most effective are, to summarize. Firstly: Use of an <M[expert group]> that consists of <U[hochrangigen]> personalities appointed by the member states in order to contribute for the <A[determination|definition]> generally acknowledged parameter for the protection of minors in the <M[media <A[field|area]>]>; secondly: Introduction of a <M[self-control-codex]> through all <M[TV societies]>; thirdly: Possibility of the promotion and the <A[access|entrance]> to <M[filter systems]> both for the television and for the Internet.
I can not agree to the demands of the liberals unfortunately.
That is and mainly remains a task of the legislation of the member countries, which, however, does not exclude a <U[konsensuale]> communication by any means onto certain threshold values in the dialog with all <A[participants|people involved]> on the European level.
Under the given conditions it is according to my <A[opinion|view]> a task of the parents to preserve <A[their|her]> children at home before this kind of programs.
Parents who following must contain are dependent especially on <A[help|assistance]> in this <A[field|area]>: Parameters for the protection of minors in the <M[media <A[field|area]>]> in the <A[entire|whole]> <A[room|space]> of the European Union, the use and <A[cheap|cost-effective]> availability of <M[filter systems]>, <M[right rules]> to the protection of the minors and the responsibility of media, enterprises and providers in the private one and in the public <A[field|area]>.
If in the case of <M[committee debates]> some say then that there are not any proofs of the negative influence of the different forms of <A[power|violence]> in the television onto children then I was amazed and hold this for a fatal <U[Verharmlosung]>.
Concerning the introduction of a <M[self-control codex]> it is to be said particularly in technical respect that radio stations elaborated already a <M[control code]> in some member states for the television the parents' is supposed to facilitate, to switch off the television set.
The pronunciation is closed.
Particularly the generalizations praiseworthy at themselves are replaced in my report by the return of the authority to decide onto the member states.
That would be the least thing in order to guarantee the <A[room|space]> of the freedom which is a basic right of every <M[union citizen]>.
There are still arrears from the year 1996.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, woman commissioner, admired colleagues and colleagues! First of all I would like to thank the reporters, Mr <U[Evans]> and Mr <U[Mantovani]>, for the achieved <A[work|job]>.
I recommend this report to the High House and approve the <A[assumption|acceptance]> of the amendments expressed by gentlemen <U[Evans]>.
Our <M[humane resources]> are our <A[only|separate]> future in a world in which knowledge means everything.
And I know still much more. One does not solve any problems with green ­, white ­, black ­ or <M[red books]>, but by means of <A[concrete|actual]> measures.
But the parliament fulfilled <A[his|its]> function and exerted pressure so that nevertheless the researchers are received into the text.
Your present visit occurs to a <A[time|moment]> that is for the future of the European <M[agreement <A[work|factory]>]> of great <A[importance|meaning]>.
We know, however, that this <A[process|trial]> is not yet accomplished and runs danger to lose <A[his|its]> vitality thus.
When we that not now, in this difficult and stormy <M[upheaval phase]> of the European and international <A[history|story]> do, when we will manage it then?
Nobody of us can say today to know exactly when and in which <A[precedence|sequence]> we will reach these <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]>. However we all are to ourselves in the clarity, that we brought already half of the <A[distance|stretch of road]> behind ourselves if we believe in them and strive for it persistently.
Worry <A[with|in the case of]> which again the same <A[inequalities|dissimilarities]> must not occur as in the more traditional sectors must be borne for women being beneficiaries of the induced <A[employments|activities|occupations]>, that is little qualified jobs, part-time work on occasionally basis not voluntary, limited <A[articles of employment|contracts of employment|employment contracts]> as well as difficult <A[access|entrance]> to <M[decision positions]>.
The <A[council|advice]> is dealt with a <A[proposal|suggestion]> to the indicators by means of which the relevant <A[progress|headway]> can be evaluated.
In a word, the fourth <A[pillar|pier]> concerning the equal opportunity means a support of the integrated approach of the equalization through the <U[Gender Mainstreaming]> and the specific guidelines.
I think in particular of acts of violence against women, one of the main topics of my <M[government activity]>, and I know, that this topic is also you a very special request.
It is known to us that the measures for the compatibility of family and profession favor in particular the women that the traditional role is not anymore if studies are also still missing <A[about|over]> the current situation of the family and the role of the woman in the family, because the <A[society|company]> has itself strong changed and with <A[their|her]> also the <M[family structure]>.
Sometimes some people, also some colleagues in this house, seem to believe that to that nevertheless like this would be however that is not right.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, you <A[make|let]> me to the end stress that the equalization begins in the own four walls.
I hold such a position for dubious and dubious, and about that should be thought my opinion in the regard onto the projects planned by you, because it is not <A[secure|sure]> that we reach in this way for the practical <A[conversion|transfer]>.
In this <A[field|area]> no equality exists.
The picture of the European woman, as it from our reports, from our guidelines turns out, does not correspond to that of those Danish women, that the euro mainly a refusal give.
So it is according to my <A[opinion|view]> <A[characteristic|typical]> that the report answers on that in all <A[fields|areas]> of the <A[society|company]>, for the example on the labor market, a numerical balance must be made between men and women.
<A[Just|Precisely]> therefore it is a missed chance that in this report <A[marriage|married state]> and family were completely ignored.
Also the committee should heed that better for the rights of the woman and equal opportunity!
We heard that the preceding <M[<A[council|advice]> premiership]> restructures the <M[equalization <A[ministry|department]>]> <A[first|only]> and abolished <M[it]> then.
The middle <M[<A[work|job]> <A[remuneration|reward]>]> of the women lies in the average 28 % under this of the men what contributes to the women defining the greatest part of the poor population, and <A[their|her]> participation in the social and political life complicates.
That is really excellent.
Across Europe a <A[process|trial]> of the impoverishment of the employed women takes place today, also in France, where after all 15 % of them have less than 3 650 <U[FF]> monthly for the life.
Not all countries succeeded in following your example, and I hope for the example of France bearing fruits in other countries.
The <A[history|story]> of the women suffices obviously far too <U[derück]>.
The <M[praying ride <A[candidates|nominees]>]> must really be helped during the takeover of the shared <M[<A[possession|property]> state]>.
In this case I need, however, your <A[help|assistance]>.
That is not the case, but a satisfactory text is, and the <M[right committee]> decided after careful consideration and a <A[detailed|full]> discussion not to present any <A[alterations|modifications]>.
The <M[right committee]> reached after long debate for the opinion that it is not <A[useful|suitable]> to receive the <M[right insecurity]> <A[uprightly|erectly]> more than six years, and that the defined period of time of three years is a more than adequate period in order to be able to find with the corresponding <A[means|resources|funds]> and an average care whether there were irregularities <A[with|in the case of]> a <A[declaration|explanation]> or not.
That is amendment 15 in which it is a question of the fraud.
To manage the <A[objective|destination|purpose]>, particularly a simplified, but qualitative communication <A[with|in the case of]> nevertheless sufficient flexibility of the <M[base <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]>]>, improvement of the procedures for the <A[collection|confiscation|conscription]> of the customs and greater adaptation of the regulations concerning the <A[registration|login]> <A[with|in the case of]> the customs <A[gives|fills]> to one of the demands of the homogeneous market, and that one was reached here, even in such a way, that many countries had been able to be inspired by in order to be able to participate in the world trade also quickly.
She thanks the parliament and in particular the committee under chairmanship of Ms <U[De Palacio Vallelersundi]> for the efforts, that both institutions for this dossier spent, and the interest that they evinced for <A[it|him]>.
Greeting
I would not like, that the <M[<A[voice|vote]> <A[delivery|output]>]> is influenced by that, however, the translation of the French <A[composure|setting|version]> must be checked real.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, I voted for the report <U[Evans]>.
It is acknowledged that <M[foreign language knowledge]> is a necessary assumption for the mobility.
In addition we think that the member states should decide even on the taxation in high measure.
A little I regretted that we did not have any chance to get a majority for the necessity to <A[formulate|word]> a limitation period for the keeping of <A[documents|pads]>.
- (<U[FR]>) At the negotiations on the contract of Amsterdam we had welcomed at that time the <A[photo|reception]> of article 13 concerning discriminations for reasons of the sex, the race, the ethnic origin, the religion or the (not sectarian) philosophy of life, a hindrance, the age or the sexual direction.
The problems of certain minorities in these countries is yes conscious of all.
It follows unmistakably from the reasons for the amendment that also the <A[intention|purpose]> to proceed against the regulations valid in the member states affecting the age which, however, are completely reasonable for <A[development|evolution]>-psychological reasons and do not have any <A[importance|meaning]> in the <M[<A[employment|activity|occupation]> life]> is pursued in this way.
I hold that also for all, what in a new article 12 <U[a]> was written together), for <A[renunciation|sacrifice]> cash.
To religion and creed. The <U[EPLP]> welcomes the basic principle of the related <M[protection worthiness]>.
. (<U[SV]>) We Christian Democrats welcome the <A[proposal|suggestion]> in the large and whole one for a guideline for the <A[determination|definition]> of a general frame for the realization of the <M[same <A[treatment|handling|processing]>]> in <A[employment|activity|occupation]> and profession.
But that states only something about the benefit of such a service <A[about|over]> the staff occupation of an internal <M[audit service]> and nothing <A[about|over]> the financial <A[importance|meaning]> and in this way.
The <U[EU]> concluded the construction of a common military responsibility in order to fulfill the so-called <U[Petersberger]> <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]> (<M[Crisis abatement]> and <M[conflict solution]> outside of the territory of the <U[EU]>), did not decree it, however, <A[about|over]> any own <M[defense <A[politics|policy]>]>.
Without <A[arms|weapons]> the world would be by far more <A[secure|surer]>.
The <M[resolution <A[request|application]>]> is not aimed at a drastic decrease of the <M[<A[arm|weapon]> sales]> for the promotion of a <A[politics|policy]> of the inverse growth, but <M[it]> would like to find only <A[regulations|arrangements]> for in order to keep on safeguarding profits to the <M[armament company groups]>.
In <A[their|her]> <A[communication|notification]> the commission recognizes indeed the problem, does not suggest, however, any <A[concrete|actual]> measures because <A[it|she]> is arrested to the thought of the liberalization of the market and the competition. All <A[their|her]> <A[proposals|suggestions]> pass by in the <A[reason|bottom|ground]> at that - especially for children - hard reality the incontinence of the multinational enterprises, to whom it is indifferent in <A[their|her]> greed for profit which effects have <A[their|her]> <A[broadcastings|programs]> and products, and that shut any responsibility to the parents that are even still stimulated to the acquisition of new products in order to protect <A[their|her]> children.
As those ones reporter, so also I think that the measures to the protection are not to be restricted to the <A[traditional|conventional]> television anymore by <A[young people|adolescents]> before violent and harmful programs, but must be valid for all media.
With three hours on the average daily television next to the sleeping is and - for the adults next to the <A[work|job]> - the most important human activity.
In addition women fill frequent "flexible" Jobs; limited <A[articles of employment|contracts of employment|employment contracts]> and <M[low wages]> are typical for the sectors in which women are mainly busy.
You are the first <A[victims|sacrifices]> during the <A[shortening|cut]> of public <A[means|resources|funds]>, the denationalization in the <M[health sector]>, the restriction of the right to <M[health <A[provision|precaution]>]> and medical <A[treatment|handling|processing]> - <A[shortenings|cuts]> that are even more perceptible <A[with|in the case of]> the right to prevention and information programs.
B5-0792 / 2000 the representative <U[Marset Campos]> and <U[Di Lello Finuoli]> in the name of the <U[Konföderalen Fraktion]> of the European united ones Con / Nordic Green left wingers for the crisis in Peru.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! I would want actually that we had a debate here once not only in the <A[connection|context]> with one or the other priority, but after a well prepared discussion in the committees above Latin America.
We must plant everything at that so that Peru with <A[candidates|nominees]> can reach the <A[objective|destination|purpose]> that of the challenge increased and in the situation to fulfill the demand of the Peruvian nation for political renewal and substantial democracy are.
The common pronunciation is closed.
Now we know Afghanistan is not removed far by that, Afghanistan is the worldwide tallest <M[opium producer]> so that we can imagine which role these political - <A[after all|by the way]> not only political - Mafias play during the expansion of the drug traffic.
The commission is called for a balance of the humanitarian aid programs for the benefit of the Afghan population so that nobody is forgotten on site.
This conflict brings <U[unsägliches]> sorrow with themselves.
For years there is a <M[budget line]>, in those one frames Mine raeum- and to be financed <M[prevention programs]>.
<A[Make|Let]> me at this place say with regard to the <A[tip|notice]> of the Ms <U[Abgeordneten Paciotti]> that I will ask the question today as a matter of course still within the commission, what happened to the <A[means|resources|funds]> for <M[mine <A[clearing|evacuation]>]> and is supposed to happen.
B5-0794 / 2000 of the Delegated Medina <U[Ortega]>, <M[link ear]> and <U[Fava]> in the name of the <A[faction|fraction]> of the Social-Democratic party of Europe for the kidnapping of a Spanish Jesuit <A[standing|being]> with the guerrilla warfare in negotiations in Colombia;
We all regret this and would want not to have to talk about Colombia again.
The commission offered already to coordinate the measures of such a <A[parcel|bundle]>. The commission already intends in the next days to confirm considerable <A[means|resources|funds]> for that.
What I hold for pitiable again once is measured therefore with two kinds of measure.
The behavior of the Albanian <M[opposition party]> is especially unintelligible to me, she shuts nevertheless here conscious a necessary solution of an Albanian problem in Macedonia.
I hold it for an extraordinary <A[achievement|performance]> of the Macedonians to come within <A[their|her]> country with each other clearly.
Therefore I also believe that this reconciliation can be lasting, but the government that found a solution for the <M[university question]> and many other questions with great courage needs visible signs of the success and needs strong support, otherwise the peace is endangered in the whole <A[region|area]>.
The <U[PHARE-Mittel]> provided in the frame of the national program for the year 2000 can be used also to the support of the university in the coming academic year, therefore 2001 and 2002.
I may stress that today already all Greek representatives commented on these <A[facts|states of affairs]> in the European Parliament.
Since indeed all these problems affect Greece, which has the biggest <M[<A[navigation|shipping]> sector]> in the European Union, they affect the <A[security|safety]> of every kind of <A[navigation|sea voyage]> takenly in the <A[reason|bottom|ground]> in the <A[entire|whole]> union.
In the last years more people lost <A[their|her]> life by far in our waters, not only through great <M[ferry boat misfortunes]>, but too often also in our <M[<A[fishing|fishery]> communes]>.
In the opposite, innocent <A[victims|sacrifices]> must suffer now so that the shipowners can put through <A[their|her]> <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]> in the widest sense.
We must be to ourselves over it being a question also of the plausibility of the European Union here in the clear one.
I would like to stress definitively that the commission is convinced by that firmly, that the question of the European <M[right rules]> must be a question of highest priority <A[about|over]> the <A[security|safety]> of packet-boats in the European Union and that it depends on guaranteeing that these <M[right rules]> are used in the whole community <A[severely|austerely]> and homogeneously.
Please you excuse, that I was late a little for reasons that are sufficiently known to you. I would like to give a short <A[declaration|explanation]> on the two topics <A[standing|being]> on the agenda: to the situation in Belgrade and in the former republic of Yugoslavia in the general one as well as the situation in the Near East.
Mr <U[Kommissar Verheugen]> will speak as Mr <U[Solana]> on the two topics, that today afternoon on our agenda stand, indeed the Near East and the <A[choices|elections]> in Yugoslavia.
We must be ready to keep this promise as soon as the will of the nation is respected.
Woman president, gentleman of High Representatives, Mr <U[Kommissar]>! I do completely not participate in this pronunciation without reservations; I did not want indeed our parliament to act as a judge to whom it is authorized to condemn this or that faced with the dramatic consequences of the new <M[<A[power|violence]> outbreak]> in the Near east, only a month <A[according to|after]> the expectations here in this hall so confidently woken, today exclusively.
Woman president! My present contribution is based not on various kinds of <M[distance analyses]>, but on my own experiences of the last week, because I was by chance in Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip when it resulted in the <M[<A[power|violence]> outbreaks]> there.
Also as an <A[opponent|adversary]> of the <A[power|violence]> one can not put the <A[power|violence]> of the Israelis and that of the Palestinians on the same <A[stage|step]>.
I would like to ask the parliament in this decisive hour to adopt a <A[declaration|explanation]> of the solidarity with the brave nation that today defended the freedom in the streets of Belgrade the same solidarity that we Europeans that fought also for <A[their|her]> freedom still few years ago <A[made|let]> the human being of other capitals <U[zuteil]> become.
The Europeans would be without doubts well to seize the occasion offered to us by the president of the Palestinian <M[legislative <A[council|advice]>]> here in this house at the bunch of hair advised.
The position of Jerusalem is a difficult point in the negotiations.
For years he succeeded with <A[his|its]> <M[propaganda machine]> and with brutal pressure on the media in deceiving the people, however, in <A[his|its]> country unfortunately also many in the western world, to feign a <A[wrong|false]> picture of the reality to them.
Since the curtain for this drama fells, it is the duty of this parliament as a symbol of a united, free Europe to support the masses before the Yugoslav parliament and to help with the perception and fulfillment of <A[his|its]> mandate Mr <U[Kostunica]>.
Exactly this irreconcilable attitude lets to fear the worst thing simultaneously - and the events of this moment underline these words that I a few hours ago noted down.
I <A[wonder|ask]> whether the <A[superintendent|commissioner]> already plans steps in this point in order to show that we really consider <U[Kostunica]> as the <A[lawfully|legitimately]> elected representative of the Serbian nation and as the partner with whom the European Union has to do from today.
The European Parliament would like to assure him in this historical moment of <A[his|its]> unlimited solidarity since the tyranny gets into the rocking and the democracy triumphs.
<A[According to|After]> the agenda the pronunciation follows <A[about|over]> the report (A5-0237 / 2000) of gentlemen <U[Seppänen]> in the name of the <M[budget committee]> <A[about|over]> the <A[proposal|suggestion]> for a decision of the <A[council|advice]> for the change of the decision 2000 / 24 / EC in the regard onto the extension of the guarantee of the community for possible losses of the European investment bank on loans for <A[intentions|plans]> in Croatia (<U[KOM]> (2000) 289 - C5-0336 / 2000 - 2000 / 0122 (<U[CNS]>)).
The new political course broken after the parliament and premiership <A[choices|elections]> in this country is to be welcomed.
A Discussing <M[task <U[Force]>]> works whose <A[objective|destination|purpose]> consists in offering <A[their|her]> competence and technical <A[help|assistance]> at the <M[contract negotiations]> to Croatia.
We must not forget that Croatia was the classical example of a completely failed privatization program <A[with|in the case of]> which only of a few profited by the denationalization until recently. This whole <A[process|trial]> must be supported.
The contribution standing for the discussion in the form of an <M[<U[EIB]> loan]> above 250 million euros for the period 2000 to 2007 can be indeed no milestone presumably however a carrying <A[help|assistance]>.
Therefore it is not very correct if in this report it is talked about a democratization.
When Croatia and Slovakia half a century ago for the first time became in particular independent, they were vassals of the <M[Hitler-regime]>.
We can not see of course also the question of the guarantees and the question Croatia free from the discussion at the evening of yesterday and the <A[development|evolution]> in Belgrade.
If it is like this that <U[Milosevic]> fled and the will of the nation gained the upperhand, then we hope for its only still lasting days up to the practical <A[photo|reception]> of normal cooperative relationships between Serbia and our union of the democracies.
I declare the session of the European Parliament intermittent on the Friday, the 6th October 2000, for resumed.
(The parliament rises to a <M[keeping quiet minute]>. )
My question says: Who is it authorized to speak in the name of the European parliament for the statute?
I ask you, woman president, to do all imaginable steps, around the running procedure in the <M[petition committee]> in the regard onto the letter of protest sent in from more than thirty social groupings and <U[NRO]> in which the <U[Petenten]> speak out against the present situation in which community rules to the radiation protection in flagrant manner are hurt, to speed up.
The autopsy carried out in Georgia made, that it <A[unequivocally|unambiguously]> about a murder, probable in touch with torture, sold has.
We brought the occasion your dream - that mine is not in the remaining one - a big piece.
This is the basic legislation and the <A[basis|element]> for every other legislation of gene-technically changed plants.
<A[It|He]> comes obviously into the other one from a <M[fat cell]>.
(The <A[meeting|session]> is suspended at 17.40 o'clock and resumed at 17.50 o'clock. )
<A[According to|After]> the agenda the report follows (A5-0291 / 2000) of Ms <U[Van Lancker]> in the name of the committee for <A[employment|activity|occupation]> and social matters <A[about|over]> the <A[communication|notification]> of the commission onto the <A[council|advice]> (<U[KOM]> (2000) 379 - C5-0508 / 2000 - 2000 / 2219 (COS)), the European Parliament, the economic and social committee and the committee of the <A[regions|areas]> for the sociopolitical agenda.
The <A[importance|meaning]> of this open <M[coordination method]> to emphasize does not mean, this method is supposed to go onto the place of the social legislation that is necessary in the frame of a European home market since we must define social rights also in Europe, dare to <A[formulate|word]> social <M[least standards]> and enact <M[social laws]>.
We in addition plead in our comment for the dialog and the cooperation with the <M[<A[civil|civilian]> society]> and particularly with the <M[woman <A[associations|dressings]>]> in the countries which prepare themselves for <A[their|her]> <A[entry|joining]> to our European family at the present time, because also there we must initiate in time a <A[harmonious|harmonic]> <A[development|evolution]> which follows the model of the remaining Europe into theory and practice.
For the fields of activity counted in the <A[communication|notification]> of the commission also general <A[correspondence|agreement]> exists.
At this point of my speech I would like to remind of a <A[class|seminar]> that is organized on this topic at the 4th and 5th December in <U[Biarritz]>, and that I will lead.
With regard to the abatement of the exclusion we have on the 17th October on that Rat "<A[activities|occupation]> and social matters" large achieved <A[progress|headway]> and defined adequate <A[aims|objectives]> in the fight against the poverty and the social exclusion that are supposed to serve for the national plans as a <A[basis|element]>.
From some <A[circles|rings]> I belonged, that one agrees after the reading of the report of indeed the diagnosis, not however the prescribed <A[prescription|recipe]>.
The technological <A[development|evolution]> and the new organizations speak certainly also for a flexible cooperation, at which less onto <A[inflexible|rigid]> <M[procedure <A[regulations|arrangements]>]>, but rather onto <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]> and results is put.
Exactly on that in our eyes the <A[antiquated|old-fashioned]> too <U[derückzuführen]> <A[opinions|views]> are, of which those ones are accused that do not expect of a liberalized market that <A[it|he]> controls all to the best.
That contributed in a <A[leading|substantially]> way to the social rest in our country and consolidated the confidence with foreign <M[direct investors]>.
Meanwhile the chosen method appears rather questionable to me.
If we speak of a charter of the basic rights and face a European <A[Constitution|State]> benevolently, we must not be shortsighted, but we must express openly that all necessary steps must be done even if one needs more exact rules for this purpose.
<A[Critically|Crucially]> I would like to say missing initiatives for the new challenges in the industrial safety, in the <M[employee <A[participation|share]>]> and in the <M[<A[work|job]> relationships]>.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, also I would like the reporter, to congratulate the woman of commissioner as well as the Ms <U[Ministerin Péry]> on this representation of the sociopolitical agenda.
We know that these points are opposed through the <A[conservatives|Conservatives]> in Europe. We, however, in our <A[faction|fraction]>, put on very special value.
The third contents-related feature affects the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]>.
The vote occurs on the Wednesday at 12.30 o'clock.
The measures of the commission should be complemented with an inspection of the effects of the <A[access|entrance]> for the individual to medical care, to the social security and to the <M[occupational pension scheme system]> as well as with an investigation of the shortcomings in the <M[<A[work|job]> organization]> and maybe also the question of some general shorter hours.
In this <A[way|manner]> the women will feel near to Europe, but also Europe will profit by the interesting and innovative ideas which will arise from the <A[link|obligation]> for this program.
We expect an annual report of the president of the commission in the frame of a pronunciation occurring annually in the European Parliament.
Furthermore I am pleased with an improvement of the measures by which the compatibility of professional and family lives is supposed to be facilitated being planned for the <M[child care]>.
My <A[faction|fraction]> will consider this in <A[their|her]> <M[final vote]>.
(The president extracts the word from the speaker. )
My opinion's the new approach of the commission is distinctly positive and the <A[proposal|suggestion]> for a decision for the program for the period 2001-2005 well thought over.
In my opinion the amendments numerous, approved by us reflect the common position which the commission and the <M[woman committee]> in this question take.
On the one hand I received in the <A[race|course|running]> of the last year of inquiries from several enterprises that felt a certain powerlessness in the <A[connection|context]> with the <A[test methods|test procedures]> last but not least in the cases in which an <A[appointment|appeal]> had to be asked for against the decision of the commission near the <A[court|dish]> of first authority.
I would also like to take the opportunity and to ask gentlemen <A[superintendent|commissioner]> <U[Monti]> when the <A[conversion|transfer]> of a list public, effective and functioning well <A[about|over]> state aids is to be expected and in addition, when the already long indicator held the prospect is realized.
Furthermore I would point out to Mr <U[Monti]> <A[wider|broader]> <A[room|space]> should be arranged to the <M[credit trade]> in the next report.
What I said is not valid only in the <A[field|area]> of the <M[energy <A[politics|policy]>]>, but it is valid in total also for other <A[fields|areas]>.
Mr <U[Kommissar Monti]>, in the name of the Italian radicals also I would like to thank the reporters for the good <A[work|job]> that they achieved with the two reports in which they give a flattering <A[assessment|judgment]> of the activity of your person and the <M[general <A[management|head office]>]> competition.
I accentuate this therefore because the market can not control everything and does not give it also any boundless competition in this sense and may give.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! Nobody denies nowadays - and I <A[natural|unaffected]> neither -, that the state aids change the terms of competition and are in this respect from evil when they favor the <U[Ineffizienz]> of the enterprises.
So was to hear it at least already strangely that he denies the <A[drop|decline]> of the state aids in the period 1994-1998 although nevertheless the commission itself arranges this.
My comment affects of course that one XXIX. Report of the commission about the <M[competition <A[politics|policy]>]>, nevertheless we do not come now, on the past too <U[derückzublicken]>.
In the <M[speech time]> suiting me for the <A[decree|disposal]> I would like to pay attention to the following three topics: Modernization of the <M[competition right]> of the community, activity in the year 1999 for the enforcement of the <M[competition rules]> and finally the state aids.
The commission is always decided against <M[cartel <A[educations|formations]>]> and intervened against the <A[abuse|misuse]> of controlling the market positions.
Mr <U[Rapkay]>, the commission puts <A[big|great|large]> value onto the support of <A[their|her]> <M[competition <A[politics|policy]>]> through the European Parliament, and I do not have the impression that this support decreases.
This system can be activated to the foundation of the European Communities either on <A[request|application]> of a member state or according to article 119 of the contract, a <A[definition|purpose]>, that during the third phase of the economic and currency union only still for the states with <M[exception <A[regulation|arrangement]>]>, at the present time therefore for Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden, is valid.
In future that one should only <A[remain|stay]> possible option the resort to the capital market.
I ask therefore for the report finding the approval of the house in the present <A[composure|setting|version]> and thus also in the <A[field|area]> of the <U[Rebpflanzgutes]> the European home market being able to be used.
That <A[it|she]> must be changed now is onto the further development of the <U[phytosanitären]> rules and onto the scientific and technical <A[progress|headway]> too <U[derückzuführen]>, that were reached particularly at the <U[in-vitro-Vermehrung]>.
When <U[Bezug]> is taken by this <M[<A[provision|precaution]> principle]> further onto the possibility of genetic changes, the <A[intense|intensive]> <A[use|commitment|insertion]> can be lowered for example from plant-protective agents.
Definitively I would like to say, that we in the interest <M[<A[provision|precaution]> principle's]>, if the articles <A[just|now]> named by me and amendments would follow should unfortunately not too <U[derückgezogen]>, then, as also the <A[wine-growers|vintagers]> demand it the <A[opinion|view]> of <U[Marianne Isler Béguin]> and accordingly of the committee for <M[environmental questions]>, national health and consumer protection and for <A[their|her]> cancellation would have to tune.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, if you allow: Mr <U[Kommissar]>, <A[could|might]> you explain us your point of view for the amendment of the committee for <M[environmental questions]>, national health and <M[consumer <A[politics|policy]>]>? It is a question of the amendment 1.
The only controversial point was, whether I would have been supposed to take the decree immediately after <A[his|its]> transmission through the French government <A[about|over]> the deprivation of the mandate of gentlemen <U[Le Pen]> to <A[protocols|minutes]> or not.
I remind you of this vote not occurring before at 12.30 o'clock.
In the <A[field|area]> justice and I am interior optimistically with regard to a solution for the <U[justitielle]> civil law cooperation.
The <M[preparation group]> will continue <A[their|her]> task fully up to the 19th November, the date of the next meeting on <M[minister level]>.
We needed such a stimulating climate, as Mr <U[Moscovici]> explained, and also I had been able to perceive the very strong feeling of a common, historical responsibility to a historical <A[time|moment]> of the European agreement with the state and government leaders.
Attention must be paid only to that, that we now in these questions of the qualified majority not behind the spirit or the climate of <U[Biarritz]> too <U[derückbleiben]>.
The small countries are not the recipients of an order of the big countries of the European Union!
I would be the current <M[<A[council|advice]> president]> thankful if <A[it|he]> explained this point.
On the one hand the presence of president <U[Kostunica]> was a historical event.
Woman president, Mr <U[Ratspräsident]>, Mr <U[Kommissar]>! <A[Progress|Headway]> was achieved indeed at the increasing cooperation and the expansion of the decisions with qualified majority, nevertheless far-reaching <A[differences of opinion|controversies]> still exist in the <A[council|advice]> with regard to the composition of the commission and the <M[<A[voice|vote]> weighting]> as you underlined.
It <A[rather|earlier]> seems to me that we move in the opposite direction.
Who does not follow the increasing cooperation has the freedoms of a car passenger on the back seat of a motor vehicle.
Also I would not like myself - nor less than you - into the <A[internal|inner]> matters of Germany mix in, nevertheless I think that this point of view is completely coherent and goes into the direction wanted by the commission in the remaining one if I do not deceive myself.
We began an exchange of ideas with the member states <A[about|over]> this question which it follows from that all member states approve the maintaining of this upper limit after the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]>.
This will not be certainly the case.
Firstly, one had now and then the impression that in <U[Biarritz]> a certain obsession of the debate predominated between small and big states.
Concerning that not saying it sufficiently according to my opinion the <M[community procedure]> must be preserved is.
Also <A[according to|after]> the <A[entry|joining]> of the present <M[<A[candidate|nominee]> countries]> every member state must keep a junior or senior <A[superintendent|commissioner]>.
The formulation of article 93 is the more problematically that it will be as good as impossible after the first <M[<A[entry|joining]> wave]> successfully carried out to achieve <A[progress|headway]> in the direction of qualified majority faced with the fact.
The citizens of these countries must be convinced of the undisputed advantages which every new European contract with themselves brings.
It it would mean to misjudge the deep-lying reasons of this crisis, one wanted to accept, that the fears had since generations without new vibrations of a final pacification that is the <A[precondition|prerequisite]> for a reconciliation <A[could|might]> do place.
Also the only quite weak reverberation worries me onto the demand of the parliament for democratization.
Nevertheless in this case the strengths which still require the realization of comprehensive reforms before the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> can presumably <A[rather|earlier]> be reproached for that.
On the One Hand the decision of the head of the government of Israel to freeze the <M[peace negotiations]> because of the use of force in the zone and to concentrate <A[his|its]> efforts on the <A[education|formation]> of a <M[state of emergency government]> with the leader of the opposition, Mr <U[Sharon]>, stands.
As a matter of course we took the victory of the Yugoslav nation and the choice with indescribable joy of Mr <U[Kostunica]> to the president for the knowledge.
I recommend Mr <U[Barón Crespo]>, nevertheless to ask <A[his|its]> Italian colleagues for a reason for why they participate in the government in Italy with a distinctly communist party and prepare themselves for the participation in the <M[parliament <A[choices|elections]>]> with another distinctly communist party, the <U[Partito della rifondazione comunista]>.
Here there would have to be <A[progress|headway]> in the procedure of the <U[Mitentscheidung]>.
The commission is <A[rather|earlier]> in the situation to give these impulses in future with the possibility of the simple majority <A[with|in the case of]> votes in the commission for this purpose.
Now no visionaries that look is <A[fixated|fixed]> on the year 2030 are needed in the union but to recognize people with solutions that are in the situation the problems that the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> to be managed within 3-8 years brings, and to find <A[answers|replies]> to that.
It is a question therefore of a <A[work|job]> achieved under open conditions which was not pre-set from <A[above|up]> or put through.
The pronunciation is closed.
If this basic checkpoint disappears, one does not get on at best anymore, in the worst case one kills oneself <A[mutually|reciprocally]>.
The democracy feels better in Europe, however, the European democracy <U[kränkelt]>.
The European Parliament did a <A[simple|easy]> and emphatic <A[statement|testimony]> today, on the 24th October 2000, in Strasburg: Yes, you can realize the European <A[constitution|state]>, yes, we want <A[it|her]>.
Accordingly the <M[island situation]> is a sufficient criterion at itself.
I will restrict myself to the <A[core|kernel]> of the thing to which I would like to say shortly that I find <A[it|him]> excellent in my concentrating on the essential points of the report of the gentleman chairperson <U[Gil-Robles]>.
At first the simplification and clearer organization of the contracts.
I would like it in this case <U[bewenden]> let, because the report of the <M[<A[college|university]> institute]> of Florence <A[stands|is]> here - at least for me - not for the discussion.
According to the information - it becomes now very much technical, you forgive me that please -, in a clear majority of the <M[language <A[settings|versions]>]> in the contrast to the Italian <A[composure|setting|version]> for the <A[application|use]> of the <M[cohesion <A[politics|policy]>]> only to those at the strongest put at a disadvantage islands not the islands seem to be referred on by being there that of the premiership and in the general one.
Mr <U[Duhamel]>, you are sure in an agreed way with me in the <A[determination|statement]>, that there are not any place or at least any plausibility for considerations <A[about|over]> the future of the European integration if Nice does not become the success, at least not in the current frame.
Also it is necessary in this European <A[constitution|state]> to define the <M[task <A[distribution|dispersion]>]> clearly between the member states and the European Union and to include the dynamics of the European integration in <A[fields|areas]>, where it is indispensable to act together as in the exterior and <A[security|safety]> <A[politics|policy]>.
<A[It|She]> <A[could|might]> look also necessary in order to overcome continuous blockades.
We need a clearer <A[distribution|dispersion]> of the responsibilities and a clearer <M[subsidiarity principle]>.
As is generally known there are for this purpose highly different opinions in the different member states, <A[with|in the case of]> the different social strengths.
The end of a European <A[constitution|state]> would be, however, the opposite unfortunately exactly, and therefore we can not agree to <A[it|her]>.
Because in the increasing European house it becomes nations at the military one, at the money-political one and to give possibly at the tax-political table, and then the others, that stand off.
The second version is not <A[unequivocally|unambiguously]> correct because to one the economically outstanding fields are covered by the <M[structure grounds]> anyhow and there would not have been any reason for the discharge of the <A[declaration|explanation]> no. 30 to the other one <A[according to|after]> this interpretation.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, I will concentrate in my modest short 60 seconds on the report by <U[Olivier Duhamel]> that is distinguished since he calls the things real <A[with|in the case of]> the name. And the <U[Lyrismus]> of our reporter convinced a little while ago us finally of that.
In my opinion the <A[unit|unity]> of Europe only of political nature can be.
There should already be the new <A[constitution|state]> according to our opinion for the next <M[Europe <A[choices|elections]>]> and be able to come into force.
Accordingly a change of the Italian <M[contract text]> becomes here the Bezeichnung " at the strongest <U[benachteiligt]>" both onto the <M[island <A[regions|areas]>]> than used also for the remaining fields, and <A[according to|after]> the <A[proposal|suggestion]> of Mr <U[Barnier]> must be carried out, according to the regulations of the <A[agreement|convention]> of Vienna.
The pronunciation is closed.
Because the woman colleague said she wanted to vote against that, this amendment is invalid.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, one searches for a <A[prescription|recipe]> for the chaos obviously here.
- (<U[EN]>) <U[Trakatellis]> welcomes <U[Ich]> the <A[assumption|acceptance]> of the report through the parliament, nevertheless he sets high quality and <A[security|safety]> <A[norms|standards]> for derivates of blood or plasma.
If the European parliamentary immunity is independent, the French authorities with the cancellation of the immunity of the representative <U[Le Pen]> would have had to turn to us then.
I am especially disappointed <A[about|over]> the <M[vote behavior]> of the <U[EP]> <A[with|in the case of]> the report about the traffic with vegetative <M[increase <A[good|property]>]> of vines.
Ones hold alcohol as on the other hand tobacco and drugs for a product that can cause great damage with consumers and <A[their|her]> fellow men see the others in <A[it|him]> a <A[means|average]> for the creation of jobs and a bubbling money source.
The reporter welcomes in the general one the <A[proposals|suggestions]> contained in the <M[white book]> to the commission on this topic, is, however, worried because of the possible effects of the reform that it aims at that fundamentally to decentralize the enforcement of <M[competition rules]>.
In the pronunciation yesterday evening I had been able to congratulate indeed <U[Jonathan Evans]> on <A[his|its]> <A[work|job]>, nevertheless must I now at the beginning my <A[unequivocal|unambiguous]> <A[criticism|review]> at the too liberal one, when not really ultraliberal direction <A[his|its]> report's express.
The compound achieved this emphasis again in order to safeguard oneself half of all new jobs arising <A[with|in the case of]> projects on the Green Meadow in the <U[Ziel-1-Region]> in the coming three years.
Faced with the indignation that the consequences of this <A[politics|policy]> activate succeeds sometimes in defusing the situation at least in part with the aid of state interventions, aids and other economical or tax stimuli.
(The <A[meeting|session]> is suspended at 14.06 o'clock and resumed at 15.00 o'clock. )
Let's <A[stand|be]> now in the October 2000 like this shortly before the decision <A[about|over]> the <M[number scaffold]> of the budget 2001.
That did not hinder the <A[council|advice]>, however, to shorten in total 555 million euros at the <U[Agrarausgaben]>.
Furthermore we think of course simply on top that simply <A[besides|in addition]> 400 places must not be created.
I can only say to the <A[council|advice]>, you follow us!
Therefore the administration of this house is for the representatives there and not reversed.
The European Court of Auditors turns us into the time at the least worrying.
Finally also the budget of the <U[Ombudsmanns]> of us is to be dealt with.
In the opposite we think that <A[just|precisely]> in the regard onto the <M[<A[entry|joining]> countries]> the <M[research <A[field|area]>]> should be forced.
In addition we suggest that the parliament keeps on being taught regularly.
And when a legislative <U[Konzertierung]> to social matters occurs, to culture or environment - the commissioner will give me right -, then we get together, in order to pray together, the commissioner for budget, the Ministers of Finance and the members of the <M[budget committee]> that no financial inconsistency is inspected.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, my ladies and gentlemen representatives, woman commissioner, very much admired ladies and gentlemen! <A[Many thanks|Thanks a lot]> for the friendly reception.
Rather he already in first reading approved the <M[budget <A[means|resources|funds]>]> that appear justified for 2001 to him without indulging in tactical considerations that the <A[objective|destination|purpose]> of an adequate application of funds which the <M[community institutions]> keep on having to strive for only detrimental would have been.
Before you decide on the <M[budget draft]> in 2001, I would like to emphasize a series of <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]> <A[about|over]> which unanimity exists between <U[Rat]> and parliament and those ones can lead for an agreement between the two branches of the <M[budget authority]>.
In the structural policy we are in a similar situation.
Also the <U[Konzertierung]> in the summer - Mr <U[Colom i Naval]> referred to that - had also put a good result to the parliament for the <A[decree|disposal]> indeed that future improved information <A[with|in the case of]> <A[edition|distribution]>-effective <M[right <A[basics|bases]>]>.
I may remind of in the financial planning concluded in the last year for the Balkans only 1,85 billion being planned for the whole period to 2006.
I ask once again for considering this <A[proposal|suggestion]> also impartially and understanding it as a possibility into the eye - the commission lets <A[their|her]> <A[proposal|suggestion]> on the table.
The material was very useful obviously both for the planning of the budget 2001 and for the <A[discharge|release]> for the year 1999.
So very I when member of the <M[budget committee]> estimates the <A[work|job]> of this committee, and so very much I also the <A[work|job]> the reporter and worthy of the reporter of the <M[budget committee]>, nevertheless I do not want to fail as a reporter for the committee for economy and currency to refer to two amendments that the committee presents in the plenum once again and whose <A[importance|meaning]> is not very <A[inessential|insignificant]> in spite of smaller amounts.
With these measures we want to make the juridical control again fully operatively to restore the confidence in the legal security of the <U[EU]> and to consolidate the European Union as a <M[right community]>.
The substitute-free cancellation of this initiative carried out by the commission was a clear disregard of the political will of Lisbon and the priority of this house.
This decision was very strange and a lot of us with the feeling that this important program had simply become the cue ball between the <M[budget committee]> and the commission let too <U[derück]>.
My third point is the European <A[agrarian policy|agricultural policy]> as there is it for us now in the <M[budget preliminary design]>.
If the <A[employment|activity|occupation]> represents a political priority of the union, then the <A[fishing|fishery]> as a further sector of the economy may stay not outside before.
I am especially pleased with the financing being able to be safeguarded for the programs of <U[SOKRATES]>, YOUTH and CULTURE 2000 decided on to the last change of year.
To patrol the <A[remains|arrears|sediments]> during our <M[Mediterranean Sea <A[help|assistance]>]> for example onto the budgets of several years.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, in the last years I was a speaker of the committee for culture, youth, <A[education|formation]>, media and sport, in whose names today afternoon spoke Ms <U[Iivari]>.
Nevertheless I would also like to say to the representatives in the present afternoon that we should not lose from the eyes, that the <U[EU]> uses only 1 % of the BIP and a <A[big|great]> part of that is <A[administered|managed]> in the member states.
I may turn now to the general strategy.
Here I would have arrived now <A[with|in the case of]> the strategy of my <A[faction|fraction]>, because the aim to safeguard a <M[cost-benefit-<A[relation|proportion|relationship]>]> as favorable as possible for the European citizen forms the starting point of our convictions.
In the opposite, we must work for a parliament that kicks in for transparency, efficiency and an effective democratic control of the European organs.
Then we must be concerned as we solve this problem.
We want to drive forward <M[democratization <A[processes|trials]>]>, and we want a balanced <A[relation|proportion|relationship]> between the classical <M[political fields]> of the foreign policy which we have now before ourselves.
The greatest problem in the new <M[budget draft]> affects the external measures.
Economical managing is as a matter of course necessary, is supported by us, and <A[about|over]> that we should cheat us also not away.
This is an extraordinary initiative, in particular in the first reading, and it is a thankless initiative since she will not find any majority of votes under the current circumstances.
In spite of that the <A[extent|circumference|volume]> of the <M[budget approach]> raises some problems for Kosovo.
With the budget policy we must gain the confidence of the citizens in the European <A[politics|policy]>.
All measures for the <A[strengthening|refreshment]> of the small and mid <A[companies|operations]> are also to be supported therefore.
the <A[extent|circumference|volume]> of the carrying out of the budget,
If one retains this strategic line as an approach for the budgets of this and the coming years, the parliament takes <A[his|its]> place then in the <M[budget procedure]> fully and very.
With the <A[transfer|transmission]> of 175 million euros about 25 million euros more for the <A[decree|disposal]> suit us than we had expected.
The <A[council|advice]> the <M[mid <A[links|obligations]>]> are not a problem declared as the topic <U[MEDA]> there years long arrears were piled up.
I believe, Mr <U[Duff]> was this morning present when we paid attention to the European <A[Council|Advice]> of <U[Biarritz]>.
My <A[answer|reply]> to that is very <A[simple|easy]>.
<U[Ramiro Zapata]> was the last one of the murdered 25 <M[human rights activists]>, and recently the Colombian press published this "Plan 100" this paramilitary groups, after which 100 <M[human rights activists]> should be murdered.
The present attitude of the <A[council|advice]> makes me a little more satisfied than those of July, nevertheless the European Union internationally always seems to appear as we experienced it already in many <M[crisis situations]> than last in Erscheinung and bring <A[their|her]> <A[voice|vote]> to hearing.
My inquiry says, and in this way I come to the conclusion, whether no possibility gives to exert a stronger pressure, when by the president in <A[his|its]> information was suggested, and whether the <A[help|assistance]> that we want to give of the <A[help|assistance]> of the United States will be distinguished in this respect basically that she puts not onto the <U[Fumigation]> of the plantations, but onto the <M[new growing]> of other cultures and not onto the military ones, but onto the social aspects.
The questions asked by me and the other representatives refer very actually to the situation in Colombia.
Since they affect the same topic, the inquiries are treated Nr. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 together.
Affects: Taxation of the financial transactions The demand for a taxation of <M[speculation capital]> wins in the last months more and more at <A[ground|bottom]>. Numerous <M[<U[ATTAC]> committees]> were used (<U[Association pour une Taxation sur les Transactions financières et pour]> l '<U[Aide]> <U[aux]> <U[Citoyens]>) like this into France and Europe and <A[imported|incorporated]> in the French national assembly as well as in the senate amendments.
Furthermore one should answer also the question which influence she would have onto the volatility of the foreign exchange markets in particular <A[with|in the case of]> a <A[sentence|set]> of 0,1 per mille while the speculators are reckoning devaluations in the <A[range|order of magnitude]> of 20 to 50 %.
Under digit 26 <A[it|she]> demands furthermore the use of an international <U[Schiedsorganisation]> for the cancellation of the debts of the countries of the south.
That one was <A[after all|by the way]> the case, independent of that, also in the <M[year <A[standard|scale]>]> at the euro whether one regrets this or welcomes.
To the, what <U[Danielle Auroi]> has said a little while ago concerning the countries of the south, would like to add I, that the estimates of specialists contain interesting numerical data, so for example, that a tax would produce gains of 50 to 250 billion dollars in the kind of the <M[<U[Tobin]> tax]> while according to <A[calculations|computations]> of the <U[UNDP]> 40 billion dollars per annum were sufficing in order to safeguard a minimum of living conditions for the hundreds of millions of people that it lacks in the countries of the third world at everything.
In the last months the epidemic occurred among other things in different parts of France.
Now since the representative of the French premiership is present I would like to know whether the <U[Schlachtung]> of the cows is paid from the <M[EU budget]> or from the national budget and whether it is made after your estimation to settle it from the <M[EU budget]>.
I ask you around your consent for its being able to be answered now.
The <M[action elbow room]> the both affected government is restricted by the international right therefore.
What needs it, and the <A[council|advice]> in the July is <U[schleierhaft]> to me as the commission can comment on that already in the February.
If the union puts such procedure on the day in the name of the subsidiarity, release her in reality of a task to be fulfilled by <A[it|her]>, so as she put this both in Northern Italy and in Spain in the last weeks.
<A[As|How]> I can permit as a representative of the European parliament to which this majority suits at the heart that 11,5 billion pounds are spent of British tax money - that is our present <M[year contribution]> - if the <A[wide|broad]> public does not <A[support|be|stand]> that?
With a flexible attitude on the part of the <A[council|advice]> an agreement <A[could|might]> be found in second reading in order to finish the budget.
If somebody must still be convinced, he looks at the <A[evidence|proof]> so.
<U[Joan Colom i Naval]>, the vice-president, responsible for buildings, already presented this strategy.
As Ms <U[Kommissarin Schreyer]> already mentioned, the this year's <M[budget draft]> contains many political <A[messages|embassies]>. The <A[rearrangement|new layout]> of the <A[agrarian policy|agricultural policy]>, new <M[structure programs]>, protection and better realization of the structural policy, <A[conversion|transfer]> of the decisions of the summit conference of Lisbon for the creation of a stronger and more competitive <U[EU]> and for the abatement of the social exclusion.
The <M[<U[NATO]>-war]> destroyed too much and left behind too great sorrow.
In spite of the reached <A[accords|agreements]> I <A[wonder|ask]> now and then whether it is possible to reach this <A[objective|destination|purpose]> in the frame of the existing <M[budget <A[compulsions|obligations]>]> without <U[untergraben]> the <U[Agrarhaushalt]> <A[which|who]> is vital for a lasting <M[agriculture sector]> in the present member states.
And I answered to them <U[klipp]> and clearly: <U[Kostunica]> must get <A[his|its]> chance here and will guarantee then also for an amnesty it is to be hoped in the next weeks or months, meanwhile, however, I am absolutely for on political level and with regard to the budget political conditions being linked at the introduction of these two new <M[budget lines]>, democratization and reconstruction.
The <A[choices|elections]> in Yugoslavia showed two kinds: The people have <A[at last|finally]> enough from the dictator <U[Milosevic]>, and they have confidence in professor <U[Kostunica]>.
I am <A[secure|sure]> that also the Albanian political prisoners are soon released to myself.
We do not do that, it becomes unavoidable on one "financial planning" came, on redistributions and <A[shortenings|cuts]> both <A[with|in the case of]> the general, social and environment-political <A[editions|costs]> and during the cooperation.
In this case initiatives to the solution of the great social problems, as e.g. the unemployment, are in demand.
As a matter of course I classify a circumstance as enormously important, that one indeed, that we with column 4 begun, to have tackled it. Still, however, it is not completely clear whether we succeeded in now a solution there also therefore not, because the <A[council|advice]> not to cooperate under any circumstances sufficiently willing is.
<A[With|In the case of]> every domestic chore it is important to set emphases.
That is not very serious with look onto the <A[outgoing|expiration]> of the contract in near future, but it would be dubious if the <M[right frame]> following in the <U[EGKS]> gave the possibility for the continuation of such practices.
That leads to my third remark, which now <A[stands|is]> before us.
The new <M[finance <A[agreement|arrangement]>]> does not give that. The distrust of the politicians in the <U[EU]> increases, so I found out.
For that they deserve recognition.
The <M[dialog <A[willingness|readiness|standby]>]> of all affected institutions facilitated an unprecedented cooperation, that it us, that I hope most deeply, to allow reaches in the first reading for an agreement.
We who <A[stand|are]> for the European values in a EU sceptical country have now a further argument for the European Union: a more effective protection of personal data which is in the modern <A[society|company]> of great <A[importance|meaning]> for the citizens.
I stated that in my own country now a change of the law about personal data is supposed to be carried out through which the <M[influence possibilities]> of the representatives are allotted to the decisions of the commission.
<A[With|In the case of]> numerous further points we see also problems. Here the judgment of the practice must be waited for in order surely to go.
. (<U[FR]>) The Commission would like to refer first of all to the <A[obligation|commitment]> that we all have opposite the citizens to guarantee the protection of the personal data processed from the institutions.
With this <A[declaration|explanation]> the commission accepts that the field of application of the <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]> is restricted in the frame of the first <A[pillar|pier]> exclusively onto the activities.
According to the political agreement, that the commission with the <A[council|advice]> and that achieved reporter for the purpose of <A[assumption|acceptance]> in first reading, she will refuse therefore every further amendment that is not to contain in the report <U[Paciotti]> approved of by the committee for freedoms and rights of the citizens, foreseen from amendment 69 to the correction of the amendment 41.
Therefore it is vital that the <M[personnel <A[supply|existence]>]> of the office-comprehensive group is increased within the <M[general <A[secretary's office|secretariat]>]> of the commission immediately so that a <M[consequence estimate]> coming in can be added to all <A[proposals|suggestions]> of <M[right acts]> with general range for <A[their|her]> <A[examination|test]> through the college on the basis of article 299 paragraph 2.
From the Viewpoint of the committee for right and home market stressing that one can really handle only what is also identical now suits to me at the heart.
Faced with the <A[importance|meaning]> of the <A[fishing|fishery]> for the <A[regions|areas]> in utmost <M[edge situation]> that saddens me very much.
Since under the premiership an office-comprehensive group was formed by <U[Delors]> for the <A[regions|areas]> in utmost <M[edge situation]>, we have a long and fruit-bearing way too <U[derückgelegt]>, and I must express that <A[which|who]> <A[guided|led]> this group up to now the deeply felt thanks of the Europeans living in utmost <M[edge situations]>.
So already indeed the Roman Contract contained a reference to the French <M[overseas departments]>, nevertheless it still lasted to 1989 and up to the <U[POSEI-Programmen]>, the programs to the solution the specific on remoteness and <M[island situation]> too <U[derückzuführenden]> problems, to the European ones union <A[at last|finally]> recognized, that the invariable character and the pressed <A[appearance|manner|occurrence]> of the structural disadvantages of the <A[regions|areas]> in utmost <M[edge situation]> justified a special processing in the comparison to the other <A[regions|areas]> of the community.
I do not doubt about the <A[proposals|suggestions]> which the commission will make to the <A[council|advice]> being shaped from these <A[properties|qualities]>.
This question becomes the more relevant the nearer the <M[EU east <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]>]> moves.
Nevertheless this right to differentiation does not keep on being anything as a result of the principle of equality, to handle also that accordingly differently is, what is different.
It is a document which my team which reaches the <A[core|kernel]> of the problems and does not ignore any one of the topics and I consider as rich at ideas and <A[proposals|suggestions]> which are <A[reason|occasion]> to concern in the <A[regions|areas]> in utmost <M[edge situation]>.
In your report, Ms <U[Sudre]>, the necessity of a <A[durable|permanent]> work is emphasized to right.
During the <A[resuscitation|revival]> of the economical diversification we achieved <A[progress|headway]> in several essential <A[fields|areas]>.
Now it depends on a great number of projects being suggested to the <U[EPPD]> in the frame nevertheless parallel to this activity on site we must analyze the specific <A[need|requirement]> the specific <A[access|entrance]> of each of these <A[regions|areas]> in utmost <M[edge situation]> comprehensively.
Permission of the <A[protocols|minutes]> of the preceded <A[meeting|session]>
As a matter of course I will inform the president of your <A[tip|notice]>.
I do worries myself <A[about|over]> that that numerous devices turn out and the decisions of the house <A[could|might]> be questioned because the necessary <A[regulations|arrangements]> are missing for such a case.
Both this <M[food authority]> and the <M[legislative <A[proposals|suggestions]>]> presented to us that are <A[focused|done]> on the <A[guarantee|warranty]> of the <M[food <A[security|safety]>]> will receive the support of this parliament, Mr <U[Kommissar]>.
The emphasis of <A[their|her]> activity lies on the scientific <A[consultation|discussion]>, because the discussion about <M[food <A[security|safety]>]> must be led equally on an <A[objective|factual]> <A[basis|element]>.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, I would not like to fail to express my thanks to the reporter for <A[his|its]> constructive contribution and for <A[his|its]> <A[willingness|readiness|standby]> to consider the comments of the other committees.
If we are confronted with a potential risk, the <M[<A[provision|precaution]> principle]> must come for the <A[application|use]>.
What the still question always in dispute to what extent we are supposed to include also topics as the <A[feeding|nutrition]> as well as the <A[consultation|discussion]> and support of the places that carries out the <M[risk management]> in the range of tasks of this authority affects, we think, that at least the possibility to give a comment and to offer <A[their|her]> support should be granted this authority for <M[food standards]> in all questions of the <M[food <A[security|safety]>]>.
From central <A[importance|meaning]> the <A[preservation|conservation]> of the rich traditions is in this case.
Such a recognition will find it not through <M[right rules]>, not through <A[regulations|arrangements]>, but through integrity, through scientific top quality, through independence, through <M[account duty]>, through transparency and through intelligibility.
Good scientific knowledge is certainly vital if one liked to evaluate the risks better in the <A[connection|context]> with the food chain, of the stable up to the table.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, no doubt about the <A[equipment|institution]> of a European agency being supported for <M[food <A[security|safety]>]> as our reporter would like to name <A[it|her]> generally exists.
If the <M[WHO program]> receives the necessary <A[means|resources|funds]> as well as the necessary support also furthermore, we do not need any additional agency. That is valid particularly for an agency with a range so restricted on the 15 member states of the European Union.
<M[Food <A[security|safety]>]> is the <A[basic|fundamental]> assumption for the consumer, because the consumers want to eat healthily, and for that we must <A[bear|carry]> worry.
If we do not get any new guideline, we will only be able to smile at many things in the <A[field|area]> of the <M[food <A[security|safety]>]>.
Subsequently changes are necessary so in the <M[EU contract]> so that <M[sanction possibilities]> are given to the commission in the <M[food <A[field|area]>]> into the hand as she today already on the field of the competition has these.
I support all shared partners, whether in political, administrative or in other working groups, that at the strategies "food for all" chamfer.
I do not agree to this <A[statement|testimony]> in this respect when a human being is now more than only a body.
The authority must be the actual head of the coordination of the net of the national agencies that in turn some networks of the <M[<A[top|peak]> research centers]> must bring onto the way for <M[food <A[security|safety]>]> on the level of the <A[single|individual]> <A[regions|areas]> and that coordinate.
Your amendment 11 and my amendment 17 might subsequently absolutely be to be brought with each other in tune.
The reform of the <M[food rules]> in the European Union should occur on the level of the European Union.
In <A[his|its]> report amendments are not presented so very much set as rather emphases.
In the report we <A[formulated|worded]> this demand <A[unequivocally|unambiguously]>, which exceptionally I welcome.
The creation of a European authority for <M[food <A[security|safety]>]> is to be evaluated, however, extremely positively.
In the interest of all <M[union citizens]> it is to want that these criteria are also kept to then.
According to my <A[opinion|view]> <A[concrete|actual]> periods must be defined within which the European Commission is to be informed about every case which gives reasonable <A[reason|occasion]> to concern.
The <U[EU]> must guarantee standards as high as possible <A[their|her]> citizen in the <M[food <A[field|area]>]>.
The commission suggests now the <A[equipment|institution]> of a European <M[food authority]>.
I ran the worry, that Europe renewed danger, to afford a bureaucracy blown up, <A[which|who]> is incapable act.
Each more new bureaucratic levels we create and each more money we spend, the little <A[makes|lets]> himself through that be caused.
Prevent similar and parallel <A[works|jobs]> in several institutions.
Nevertheless it is regarded to avoid that in the shadow of the discussion about the <M[white book]> the fear of the public of a bureaucratic Europe that takes influence onto the quality of the products without proceeding against the health-endangering delusion and mystification of the consumers effectively is intensified.
As you know, the strategy enjoys highest priority for the <M[food <A[security|safety]>]> in the commission.
The commission will adopt a <A[proposal|suggestion]> for a <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]>, <A[who|which]> will form the frame for future <M[health protection measures]> in the <M[food <A[field|area]>]> and by which ones the superordinate basic principles and <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]> of the <M[food right]> are defined.
<A[Many thanks|Thanks a lot]>, Mr <U[Kommissar]>.
However, now too to our report: I interpret the <A[proposal|suggestion]> of the commission as positive and must say that the committee for foreign affairs, human rights, common <A[security|safety]> and <M[defense <A[politics|policy]>]> as well as the committee for <A[development|evolution]> and cooperation of our parliament achieved an <A[intense|intensive]> <A[work|job]>, around <A[it|him]> as far as possible, in particular in certain points, to keep on improving.
As already our colleague <U[Bonino]> expressly and clearly mentioned, a further step was done forward with the <M[<A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]> <A[proposal|suggestion]>]> of the commission.
We hold the <A[proposal|suggestion]> for a <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]> of the commission for too vague.
It is necessary, that the equipment for <M[mine <A[clearing|evacuation]>]> is organized correspondingly <A[reasonable|sensible]> and that we finance <A[studies|investigations]> for <U[Detektions]> and <A[clearing|evacuation]> <A[works|jobs]>, for instruments that can be used on site in <A[simple|easy]> <A[way|manner]> so that they bring <A[help|assistance]> <A[just|precisely]> in the developing countries.
In the last eight years we provided more than 200 million euros from the <M[community budget]> for the abatement from <M[country mines]>.
We can not punish, however, the population for <A[their|her]> incapable government.
As I already said, it would be well-meant indeed from my <A[view|sight]>, however nevertheless counterproductive and <A[wrong|false]>, to turn the <A[entry|joining]> into the <A[accord|agreement]> of Ottawa for the condition obligatory and to be fulfilled immediately for the support of <M[mine clearing-actions]> through the European Union.
I refuse amendment 19.
Secondly the international community must improve the coordination on global level and completely especially in the affected countries.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! The Social-Democratic <A[Faction|Fraction]> votes the carrying out of gentlemen <U[van]> order too and is also proud of the role of the European Union.
We remember the Soviet <M[toy bombs]> in Afghanistan!
<A[Many thanks|Thanks a lot]> for the good report.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, the Cambodians refer to the mines as eternal sentries.
Opposite uniformed strengths the people have an entitled distrust that built <A[itself|himself|herself]> up in long <M[war years]>.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! I am pleased with there being <A[at last|finally]> a European legislation in the form of a <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]> of the <M[antiperson mines]> and there being a good report by Ms <U[Bonino]> for us today <A[about|over]> this <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]>.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, Mr <U[Kommissar]>, my very admired colleagues and colleagues! We have to do it today with a very sad topic.
Not by chance the mines mainly lie in <M[crisis <A[regions|areas]>]>, that is in fields, where different initiatives <A[could|might]> be taken in order to overcome these crises.
In two kilometers a shield points out the <M[mine danger]> to <A[distance|removal]> of a Bosnian village in the year 1999 on a field, which, however, does not prevent that a small boy plays there.
It is tragic if the <M[<A[civil|civilian]> population]> must suffer from the impotence of <A[their|her]> leaders.
You allow me, representative admired, to call you welcome in the name of our institution with which your country maintains special relationships in the frame of our common <A[intention|plan]> to the construction of a zone of the prosperity, the <A[security|safety]> and the peace in the <M[Mediterranean Sea <A[room|space]>]>.
There are all mines in depots.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! Since I am agreed on almost all which my colleagues and colleagues said before, I do not want to repeat that.
Your opinion of open cooperation is tantamount to a relapse into the institutional <A[pattern|scheme]> dominated by <M[commission officials]>.
We believe also onto the <M[subsidiarity principle]> in decisions being understood so near at the concerned persons as possible.
Since, however, the essential <A[requests|applications]> of the <M[<U[EVP]>-<A[faction|fraction]>]> could <A[just|now]> find a considerable majority, I agreed to the report.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! I abstained during the vote about the results of the informal European <A[council|advice]> from <U[Biarritz]> for two reasons: To one, because I had occasion to vote in particular on the digits 2 and 5 separately and to lend both <U[Ausdruck]> through that opposite my refusal.
In Other Words, at the table of the common European house some would eat à la carte while others are must be satisfied with the <M[<A[unit|unity]> menu]>.
And the democratic control must not decrease. Nevertheless the major problem of the European Union does not <A[consist|exist]> after our estimation in the enumeration of these rights or <A[their|her]> <A[photo|reception]> in the contracts.
The instrument of the referendums and the related amendments for this report were already spoken to.
During the choice to the European parliament of 1999 the poll was only 40 % if one cashes up the countries with <M[choice duty]> and those ones <A[who|which]> simultaneously carried out national <A[choices|elections]> with the <M[Europe choice]>.
In order to reach the wanted <A[objective|destination|purpose]> of a European <A[constitution|state]>, it is not advisable, <A[severe|austere]> <M[right figures]> and methods too <U[oktroyieren]>, whose fatal consequences would be the missing of the wanted <A[objective|destination|purpose]>.
A <A[real|genuine]> social <A[constitution|state]> would have to adjust the most important achievements there for the benefit of the working world, the women, the migrants and the citizens up.
. (<U[PT]>) <U[Ich]> did not vote for that although I do not dispossess her of a praiseworthy <A[intention|purpose]> of the strengthening, light and deepening of the European Union as well as the simplification of the texts that is necessary for <A[their|her]> public-friendliness.
the <M[competence <A[distribution|dispersion]>]>
According to my <A[opinion|view]> it is from decisive <A[importance|meaning]> that the charter of the basic rights means a connection to the <M[human rights convention]> of the Council of Europe in the <U[EU]>.
The report of the colleague <U[Gil-Robles]> comes to me to help, however, because it contains the <A[proposal|suggestion]> that some member states of the European Union synchronize a common procedure with each other in certain questions, sectors and <A[fields|areas]>.
If more and more important topics are determined by qualified majority votes, basic <A[norms|standards]> of the democracy are violated.
Today attempts to hinder the flexibility of the increasing cooperation, and will be defeated also at that.
The present report is supposed to concretize the corresponding point of view of our parliament (Resolution of the 13th April 2000).
We <A[stand|are]> in the Large and Whole one of a so-called flexible cooperation positively opposite.
The British <M[<U[Labour]>-members]> of the <M[<U[PSE]>-<A[faction|fraction]>]> welcome the approval for <A[their|her]> contribution to the <A[work|job]> of the <M[government conference]> at the <A[problems|problematic natures]> of the increasing cooperation even if they are not agreed on all details.
These island areas must feel as an <A[active|acting]> component of the European Union, that <A[they|she|it]>, so I hope, into a paradise for the tourists as also for the local population will change.
In the Middle Ages these fields and <A[their|her]> population did not belong to Europe, and also today they are not regarded as really European.
In Fact the special features of these <A[regions|areas]> which result in the general one from <A[their|her]> <M[island situation]> and <A[their|her]> <A[distance|removal]> to the European mainland, but also from <A[their|her]> chronic dependence on of a few products or a single product, necessary, make that for the effort of these hindrances suitable, specific measures are taken.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, I ask around excuse if I detain the executive committee and the interpreters in this way once again for listening to my last <A[declaration|explanation]> for the vote, and I would like to show in particular my solidarity with the translators of our <M[vote <A[declarations|explanations]>]>, in my case of the Italian <U[Ornella Buson]>.
It follows clearly indeed from these texts that this agency aims at the restriction or paralysis of the national <M[protection <A[authorities|authorizations]>]> in order to put <A[it|her]> into the service of the <M[commission <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]>]>.
This does not hinder the commission and the parliament at that, however, this institution as "European authorities" to describe, although this <A[denomination|expression]> of the philosophy <A[being|standing]> behind this <A[equipment|institution]> completely contradicts.
This does not correspond exactly to what the report <U[Bowis]> <A[with|in the case of]> which one has the feeling suggests to us, the <M[food <A[security|safety]>]> is considered in the essential one as a further pretext by means of which one would keep on would like to drive forward the well-known <A[process|trial]> of the <A[strengthening|refreshment]> of the <A[authorities|authorizations]> of the commission at the expense of the national organs and the <A[security|safety]> of the citizens.
Therefore I hold it for made to condemn these incredible actions through this <A[declaration|explanation]> in the name of our European parliament which always kicked in for the <A[respect|attention|caution]> of the <M[religion freedom]> and the tolerance between all <M[belief communities]>.
Woman president! I understand the <A[insertions|slots]> to that one reporter, however with the <A[requests|applications]> of the committee for agriculture and rural <A[development|evolution]> only money is not voted, but also a certain direction is voted.
I would also like to ask you for our adjusting the <M[budget line]> <U[A-206]>, acquisition of immovables, correspondingly to support here, depending on whether which amendments are accepted so that we do not exceed our own <A[limitation|limit]> on 20 % of the <A[entire|whole]> administrative operating expenditures.
Before the vote above amendment 929
<A[Single map|Single plan]> <U[VI]>, economic and social committee
Report (A5-0276 / 2000) of gentlemen <U[Nicholson]> in the name of the committee for <A[fishing|fishery]> <A[about|over]> the <A[proposal|suggestion]> for a <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]> of the <A[council|advice]> with additional technical measures to the re filling up of the <M[codfish <A[supply|existence]>]> in the Irish sea (<M[<U[ICES]> field]> <U[VII a]>) (<U[KOM]> (2000) 0190 - C5-0219 / 2000 - 2000 / 0071 (<U[CNS]>))
(The parliament accepts the <M[resolution <A[request|application]>]>. )
The <M[food surplus]> is brought to the <U[EU]> onto the <A[international market|world market]> by the <M[export subsidies]> to <M[dumping prices]>, which leads to serious <M[competition disadvantages]> in turn e.g. for the food industry in numerous developing countries.
In order to release sufficient financial <A[means|resources|funds]> for additional relief actions on the Balkans, the member states must <U[umverteilen]> the <A[means|resources|funds]> from the available budget.
Nevertheless the parliament succeeded in putting through a series of important tasks - last but not least in the regard onto increasing efforts in the fight against unemployment and poverty, numerous important environmental and equalization questions and so forth. We have against the attacks the rights to the <M[<U[LIFE]> program]> and that <U[European Women]> 'it lobby tuned.
What affects the <M[<A[travel costs|travelling expenses]> payment]> for the representatives of the European Parliament, so we <A[observe|record]> at our opinion that this may be paid only for the costs in fact arisen in the case of official trips.
I start from that - and I hope, that the commission starts corresponding solutions constructive with -, that we will fill the three years with a transitional arrangement in between 2002 and 2005.
In order to give a regular muzzle particularly to the national parliaments, the European commission presented a <A[proposal|suggestion]> immediately in the frame of <A[their|her]> regulation and liberalization rage for a obligatory <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]> instead of a guideline that is supposed to be whipped through the parliament and the Council of Ministers in a regular <M[beating jerk procedure]> in order already on the 31st December of this year to come into force.
We support therefore the <M[reform attempts]> of the commission and refuse the further priority of this sector.
Through that they got into strong dependence from raising of credit.
Tell <U[Nicholson]> (<U[A-0276]> / 2000)
The inappropriate use of <A[means|resources|funds]> for military <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]> must be avoided.
We always represented the <A[opinion|view]>, that the costs for the reduction of the <A[emissions|issues]> of carbon dioxide and other <M[hothouse gases]> in the first place of the actual <A[causers|parties responsible]>, that is of the big industry, to be borne and to have to go at the expense of <A[their|her]> superprofits.
Report <U[Moreira]> since <U[Silva]> (A5-0271 / 2000)
This money should be used when the expenditure on the <M[research <A[politics|policy]>]> is synchronized with each other in all 15 member states of the European Union and coordinated.
In order to make provisions for that, it is correct to provide us with <A[clearness|clarity]> <A[about|over]> these substances.
In this way the <M[vote hour]> is ended.
It is supposed to go then onto the place of the now already everywhere used national format.
The balance of payments statistical loss as a consequence of this change is minimal.
You must imagine that from that really in the first place small and middle enterprises are affected.
We would <A[insist|pass]> for years on a harmonization of the efforts.
I think that this report by central <A[importance|meaning]> is around in fact the citizens and citizen, to integrate the small and mid <A[companies|operations]> also into the <M[euro <A[room|space]>]> and to increase the acceptance of the economic and currency union.
<A[With|In the case of]> free <M[capital traffic]> with the common currency no obstacles or greater differences may exist.
Nevertheless the European Parliament and the commission <A[give|pay]> that great attention.
I support the double-track procedure to that one reporter with which <A[it|she]> wants to lead the hesitant <A[banks|benches]> to moving.
We can not force the <A[banks|benches]> to loss-pregnant <A[businesses|shops]>, but as politicians we can support the amendment of gentlemen <U[Radwan]> and Ms <U[Peijs]> that they recommended for the <U[PPE-DE-Fraktion]>, in what still before end of next year measures and seems to be demanded at the best also the existence of corresponding <A[norms|standards]> at introduction of the <M[euro coins]> and ­.
The <A[request|application]> of the colleague <U[Peijs]> and me aims also into the direction, to combine the <A[banks|benches]> at a table, not to do around <A[handicaps|specifications]>, but because we can not increase the pressure anymore here now from the political <A[page|side]>.
If indeed the handling of cross-border transfers remains just as expensive as today, the plausibility of the new coin and <A[bank note|bill]> system is questioned.
Our opinion's this form of the <A[elevation|imposition|investigation|uprising]> of statistical data <A[about|over]> the union-internal payments puts a relic of the past dar, that in an integrated, homogeneous <A[room|space]> more is not to be justified and influences the flawless functioning of the home market.
When I the contributions of some my colleagues in the committee that hears than I, belonging to this house already longer, so I have the impression that the <A[practice|exercise]> with the <M[increase year program]> for enterprises and entrepreneurial initiative to which the European Parliament subjects itself now for the fourth time belongs to this category.
I thank you in the ahead of for the support of my report.
When one on European level too <U[derückzieht]>, then one must give possibilities to the <A[regions|areas]> again increasingly.
The <U[KMU]> <A[stand|are]> at first place during the job creation, both in qualitative than also in quantitative respect, and play in this <A[way|manner]> a decisive role for the social cohesion and the regional planning.
Through the careful study of the <A[proposals|suggestions]> and the vote with numerous interested <A[pages|sides]> <A[it|she]> achieved a contribution to the clearer formulation of the program and <A[his|its]> optimal preparation.
Thirdly we must make an effort for an additional European benefit.
It results from that that things go for small and <A[medium-sized|middle-class]> enterprises only then well when the unemployment is small and when the public budgets are free from debts on all levels and over sufficing <A[means|average]> to <A[have|decree|proceed]> in order to stop these into the <M[investment budget]>.
Enterprises need <A[clearness|clarity]>.
Particularly, if an one-man operation or a <A[company|operation]> among 250 employees has a project, should it not only with backups of <A[reason|bottom|ground]> and <A[ground|bottom]> with one 120 % -protection possible be, but it should be also possible to be financed with a good idea.
That is the <M[national states]> and also the regional or local corporations act really already as gigantic <M[finance pumps]> that for this purpose are there, the money of the taxpayers, the amounts collected by the majority of the population, also of the poorest, into the large-scale enterprises and to pump into the <A[bags|pockets]> of <A[their|her]> properties and stockholders in this way.
The small and middle enterprises produce thousands of tender seedlings which the large-scale enterprises use for human creativity and ideas as seed.
I would like, that the Mr <U[Kommissar]> sees with first priority in the <A[connection|context]> with all here suggested measures to an <A[access|entrance]> light to use these information effectively and fast to <A[aids|assistances]> and information being created so that those ones that lead these enterprises are in the situation.
They all will find <A[their|her]> place in the <M[increase year program]>.
Finally I welcome also the idea that we come together once in the year in order to draw balance <A[about|over]> the <A[conversion|transfer]> of the program.
The recent actions against the Greek minority in <U[Himare]> demand still more emphatically, measures for the democratization, for the <A[strengthening|refreshment]> of the institutions and to the protection of the human rights in Albania.
A considerable number of Albanians leaves <A[their|her]> home because of the insecurity in <A[their|her]> country, because of the social difficulties, because of the premodern society and family structures.
We need preventive measures tailored in particular to Albania which represent a support in the case of the construction and/or reconstruction of the country in order to facilitate such humane life in the <A[region|area]>.
So the documents are shifted from an authority to the other one, and the European Commission refuses for example to publish the report which affects among other things also the <U[Customs Assistance Mission]> <A[elaborated|acquired]> by the Albanians (<U[CAM]>).
<A[Make|Let]> us look to the truth into the eye.
Ms <U[Karamanou]>, my congratulation on that <A[wide|broad]> and comprehensive tour <U[ïhorizon]> your report's.
In this case it is a question of an extremely important question which results from historical, social, political and economical factors.
The we will never find out true number of the dead.
Common <A[businesses|shops]> create peaceful <A[links|obligations]>.
What I, however, find completely unacceptable at this report and on what I am liked to refer openly, that cause and effect, that is the illegal immigration are confused with a procedure of the evaluated <M[visa granting]> and thus the <M[migration possibility]>. It is exactly <A[reverse|opposite]>!
The great institutional reforms derived from the contract by Amsterdam had effects on the <A[treatment|handling|processing]> of problems of the <A[refugee|fugitive]> and immigration <A[politics|policy]>.
Thirdly and finally the plan and <A[his|its]> <A[conversion|transfer]> must be considered regionally.
However, of course this request also at us ourselves to deal with European regimentations economically passes.
This strength of the shared action must <A[just|precisely]> be accentuated now especially.
Further I plead for in the case of changes of existing <M[right rules]> codified <A[proposals|suggestions]> into which the changes to the existing guidelines or <A[regulations|ordinances|prescriptions]> are trained being presented to the EC.
The <M[subsidiarity principle]>, correctly understood, expels us into both directions: To make decisions on the <U[niedrigstmöglichen]> level, but to realize that the <U[niedrigstmögliche]> level can be sometimes a very high level if indeed it is a question of general values that loss threatens if they were not protected everywhere equally.
The report is a <M[<A[pattern|sample]> example]> of concise, clear formulation, and I hope, the colleagues and colleagues will take that also with great seriousness as the knowledge.
The report of the committee for right and home market did not push members at his onto enthusiasm.
I paid attention to that in the report about the <M[<U[SLIM]> project]>, because the <M[right rules]> of the community <A[just|precisely]> a <A[test|try]> gave us Mr <U[Medina]> with the picking of one of the articles of the contract are even for <A[specialists|experts]> hardly understandable.
Therefore some aspects of the report activate little enthusiasm in me, because I would have me one stronger "<U[vergemeinschaftenden]>" Bericht with respect to the home market wanted, and very obviously the report is not permeated by that <A[just|precisely]>.
For the <M[EU institutions]> it is important that we have the explicit <A[obligation|commitment]> to correct the quality of the <M[right settlement]>, in particular with look onto the subsidiarity.
The pronunciation is closed.
The living on of this state <A[could|might]> influence the <A[attitude|setting]> and the acceptance of the citizens opposite the euro negatively.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! We prepared the report <U[Karamanou]> with very great care in the committee for the freedoms and rights of the citizens, justice and <A[internal|inner]> matters.
But as a chairperson of the committee for <A[fishing|fishery]> I would like to use our verbal inquiry and this pronunciation in order to present some considerations to both <A[pages|sides]> - because our <M[resolution draft]> consults both <A[pages|sides]> -, and I would like to do that with great consideration.
This is the demand of the nations of the union which we represent here.
A lot of water ran down the Rhine, nevertheless the <A[agreement|convention]> ran out and that was not replaced.
I can understand the reasons of the gentleman <A[superintendent|commissioner]>, however not that of the president.
We <A[could|might]> say, that we keep on paying 11 months after the shut down of our ships for the previous <A[agreement|convention]> and for the previous one of the previous one.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! We had a similar debate a year ago, and the fact that it lasted a year before negotiations are incorporated <A[first|only]> shows how in a difficult way it becomes to find fish populations for our extensive <M[EU fleets]>.
With the second descendant the state of affairs was clear.
However we must understand that everything is <A[final|finite]> also the <M[<A[fishing|fishery]> resources]>!
Therefore I am interested in particular at explaining, that the <A[faction|fraction]> the <M[<U[EVP]> ED]> not only has <U[hervorgetan]>, to support the <M[<A[fishing|fishery]> descendants]>, to defend and to favor, but decided also <A[their|her]> expansion to support.
Thirdly the exploitation of the <M[catch <A[reason|bottom|ground]>]> of Sahara has been continued since the suspension of the <M[<A[fishing|fishery]> <A[agreement|convention]>]> through fleets of the community and others <A[which|who]> neither do not succumb to the control through the commission through the member states yet: One speaks particularly of a <A[significant|important]> fleet from the Netherlands.
I absolutely understand that, because the <A[fishing|fishery]> was a source of revenue and created jobs for one, measured by European <A[relations|circumstances|relationships]>, poor <A[region|area]>.
A further aspect which I would like to refer to especially is the <A[outgoing|expiration]> of the limited aids for fisherman and shipowner at the end of the month that served for this one year <A[long|old]> standstill as a <A[compensation|balance]>. This situation is intolerable, because nevertheless everyone wants to work more gladly than to get aids.
I when is Andalusian parliamentarian since a year at negotiating on the <A[walks|corridors|runnings]>, in the offices, in the <M[<A[fishing|fishery]> committee]> and in the conversations with the gentleman <A[superintendent|commissioner]> and suggesting initiatives so that the very special characteristic of the Andalusian fishing fleet is considered that carries out the <M[catch <A[company|operation]>]> in Morocco.
Spain developed the difficult neighborhood which there was in the <A[history|story]> also again and again between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco in an excellent manner positively.
As a Spanish and Andalusian representative I demand the right <M[<A[dew|rope]> sender]> of Andalusian and Spanish families to receipt and protection of <A[their|her]> jobs which are endangered since almost a year and which we must protect also from this parliament.
We come now to the vote.
An almost twelve year <A[long|old]> <A[history|story]> fuller <M[office comfort]>, <M[holding tactics]>, hopes, also personal need, around placebo for the concerned persons, around the tough defense of old rights opposite citizens that did not search anything else than <A[their|her]> good right.
As you know, the matter is extremely complex and affects about 700 employees at 25 Italian <A[colleges|universities]>.
If the Italian legal system is reformed and changed as it was the case for the <M[<A[college|university]> personnel]>, the commission of our opinion can not intervene as long as every European citizen has the same <M[<A[access|entrance]> possibilities]> to all <M[career groups]>.
The wrong consists in two people performing the same <A[work|job]> to work <A[page|side]> at <A[page|side]>, but to be paid differently and to have different working conditions.
At the worst it is, I think, if one must <A[make|do]> attentive on a judgement for <A[their|her]> advantages <A[consisting|existing]> possibly only of of a few calming words and not being important for <A[their|her]> further life actually.
I expect an <A[answer|reply]> to the point of the commission, that it offends against articles 48 (2) of the Treaty of Rome according to the decision of the court of justice in the case <U[Allué]> if in the legislation of a member state the duration is confined from <A[articles of employment|contracts of employment|employment contracts]> by <M[foreign language assistants]> in each case onto a year with the possibility of the <A[prolongation|lengthening]> while with respect to other teachers such <A[limitation|limit]> is not existing fundamentally.
Now, according to my <A[opinion|view]> these matters affect the actual <A[core|kernel]> of the <A[basic|fundamental]> principles of the freedom, in particular the freedom of movement, combined with the European right, and from these principles there must not be any exceptions.
We do not have still many fetters, many hindrances for this home market, only in this case as also the present debate shows.
We come now to the vote.
(The president extracts the word from the speaker. )
Into <M[condolence writings]> onto the Austrian Federal President <U[Klestil]> and onto Federal Chancellor bowl I brought the <A[members|relatives]> and the <A[entire|whole]> Austrian nation in this hard hour our <A[interest|sympathy]> in the name of our house to the expression.
Are there for this purpose remarks?
I support the <A[proposal|suggestion]> of gentlemen <U[Ceyhun]> and would be very thankful if the <A[council|advice]> <A[could|might]> inform whether in fact he intends to make a new <A[proposal|suggestion]> in this matter.
Woman president, dear colleagues and colleagues! Our <A[faction|fraction]> holds this event for so important that we think that it would not be handled adequately in the form of a priority.
Mr <U[Barón Crespo]>, I have the impression that you follow this reason if I have understood you correctly.
Woman president, some time ago we debated in this house on the sanctions opposite Iraq.
It is absolutely necessary that we still carry out a pronunciation before <A[conversion|transfer]> of the announced changes through the British authorities to that, and the commission must be shown <A[unequivocally|unambiguously]> in this question for the legal regulations.
(A5-0314 / 2000) of Ms <U[Roure]> in the name of the committee for the freedoms and rights of the citizens, justice and <A[internal|inner]> matters <A[about|over]> the initiative of the French republic in the regard onto the end of an <A[accord|agreement]> over the improvement of the legal aid in <M[<A[punishment|penalty]> things]>, in particular in the <A[field|area]> of the abatement of the organized criminality, the washing's of the <A[profits|yields]> from crimes as well as the <M[finance criminality]> (10213 / 2000 - C5-0394 / 2000 - 2000 / 0815 (<U[CNS]>)).
<A[Concrete|Actual]> steps must follow the letters of intent so that the <A[profits|yields]> are determined from crimes, confiscated frozen, and pulled in.
The creation of a European <A[room|space]> of the freedom, the <A[security|safety]> and the right must not remain in the hands of a specialized <A[equipment|institution]> under the <A[only|separate]> control of the national governments.
On the other hand article 8 of the draft of the <A[accord|agreement]> restricts the reasons for the refusal of the legal aid which a member state requested of can refer to to the essential interests.
First of all I would like to congratulate Mr <U[Marinho]> on <A[his|its]> <A[work|job]> and point out to at the endeavours towards the abatement of the economic crime support, but also caution being offered.
If terrorists and <A[arm|weapon]> or drug traders practice <M[money laundry]>, must that of course uncovered, followed and avenged become!
It is our task to trace the <A[profits|yields]> from the organized criminality to investigate, to freeze, to confiscate and to move in.
It is a question of these points in the amendments, and <A[according to|after]> the pronunciation in the committee judge, I am very confident, that the parliament votes for that.
It seems to me that this catalog points from initiatives into a direction that does the protection planned in article 6 of the European convention to the protection of the human rights and <M[basic freedoms]> possibly to the ground.
In reality the things are not, however, so <A[simple|easy]>.
Finally the <M[<U[EVP]>-<A[faction|fraction]>]> supports the <M[compromise amendment]> about the activity of the lawyers to which we reached with Ms <U[Roure]>.
The second measure, the second instrument is the harmonization.
That is a Portuguese initiative which already several <U[Vorredner]> commented on praisingly.
And so also the <A[objective|destination|purpose]> of the common <A[meeting|session]> said of the advice "justice and interior" and the <M[<U[ECOFIN]> <A[council's|advice's]>]> on the 17th October of this year.
The best form for a <A[strengthening|refreshment]> of the parliamentary and <U[justitiellen]> control of <M[EURO <A[POLE|TERMINAL]>]> is the complete <A[integration|linking]> of the <M[EURO <A[POLE|TERMINAL]> <A[accord|agreement]>]> to the <M[right frame]> of the European Union.
A step into the correct direction which the European Parliament already long strives for is the creation of a <A[provisional|temporal|temporary]> place for the <U[justitiellen]> cooperation.
The sense of the <A[guarantees|warranties]> <A[consists|exists]> in that, indeed in the <A[development|evolution]> of this aspect of the freedoms.
And the European Parliament is the supranational shared authority which defines these relationships. With my contribution I would like to ask you to stand up for the <A[basics|bases]> of these relationships and to give ours reporter your approval.
Only if <A[clearness|clarity]> <A[about|over]> the institutional model and the rules for the future European <M[right <A[room|space]>]> exists, the citizens and citizens and the European Parliament will be able to comment on the <A[single|individual]> measures suggested by the <A[council|advice]>.
For that <U[EUROJUST]> is a logical part of the efforts to offer the citizens a <A[room|space]> of the freedom, the <A[security|safety]> and the right as well as a high measure of <A[security|safety]> through the abatement of the difficult organized criminality.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, Mr <U[Kommissar]>, admired colleagues and colleagues! One can congratulate the Ms <U[Abgeordnete Gebhardt]> only on <A[their|her]> excellent report which she presents in carrying out of one of the <A[council|advice]> in <U[Tampere]> of understood decision.
One speaks, however, of coordination as at <U[EUROJUST]> on the level of the national prosecutions and judges in order to oppose all forms of difficult criminality - and there I agree the approach the reporter, - then that represents an <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> of the <A[draft|plan]>: it is not a question here only of cooperation anymore in the case of crimes cross-border in that, but it is a question of cooperation for the abatement of criminal actions.
We will have already from 1st January 2001 occasion to engage us in this <A[provisional|temporal|temporary]> place for the <U[justitiellen]> cooperation. Nevertheless the commission intends to give upswing to the discussion about the appearance of the final <M[<U[EUROJUST]>-place]>.
Position was gotten from all <A[pages|sides]> honestly - I mean - without sinking into <A[inflexible|rigid]> <M[<A[front|frontage]> positions]>, however.
The problems in the <A[connection|context]> with the <A[editions|costs]> were not far too alarming for the <M[<A[fishing|fishery]> committee]>; other <A[fields|areas]> are from greater interest.
It is really not acceptable that we can not have any <A[unequivocal|unambiguous]> <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]> and measure the results. There is not that in any other <A[equipment|institution]>.
Second point: In the <A[field|area]> of the hierarchy <A[with|in the case of]> the <M[<A[instruction|order]> <A[authority|authorization]>]> it resulted in actually unacceptable overlaps here, Mr <U[Kommissar]>.
I would like to make in this way clearly that the program played a positive role <A[with|in the case of]> some questions.
It is obvious that this <A[work|job]> does not lead to a duality automatically within consortiums with regard to the common financial responsibility. The problem is more complex.
We therefore really supported that, these 3,4 million too <U[derückzubekommen]>, and one can say that we succeeded in that to more than 90 %.
Are there objections?
Woman president, my ladies and gentlemen! There is the charter of the European basic rights to nine month long <A[work|job]> and long struggle around a consensus now in the draft.
I hope for this parliament not <A[making|letting]> in the next weeks even if only yes says it with regard to this <M[basic right charter]> today any doubt about that arise, its requiring the legally binding effect of this charter from the <A[council|advice]> and this charter having to reveal the people also an <A[access|entrance]> to the European Court of Justice.
This position agrees as is generally known with the one of the state and government leaders on the meeting of the European <A[Council|Advice]> in <U[Biarritz]> that approved of the charter unanimously and unconditionally. I can only ask you therefore in the name of the <A[council|advice]> to follow this position when I explain you some reasons for that.
Particularly, however, one will attain the charter <A[according to|after]> my conviction through <A[their|her]> contents-related <A[weight|emphasis|importance]> - how I would like to say - <U[epochale]> <A[importance|meaning]>.
The European <A[Federation of Labor Unions|Federation of Trade Unions]> <A[for his part|for its part]> existence of gaps complained about that - how he <A[calls|names]> it -, as for example the <A[absence|lack]> of a reference to the right to a <M[least <A[income|revenue]>]>.
Independently of that several personalities have, and in particular it unites members of the European Parliament, suggested, to record an explicit reference to the <M[basic right charter]> in article 6 of the <M[union contract]> that contains already a reference to the European <M[human rights convention]>.
Our <A[faction|fraction]> agrees except for the British delegation to the charter unanimously.
We enter as a European People's Party together and unanimously for the <M[basic right charter]> being <A[received|recorded]> as soon as possible into the contracts so that she unfolds also immediate force of law for the people in the European Union.
You showed us that one can come closer to the European questions in a new and exemplary <A[way|manner]> which due to <A[their|her]> democratically open and transparent working method and the possibility of the citizens' participation of the form of the <M[government conference]> considering is.
The right to health, on social security, on apartment or onto a <M[least <A[income|revenue]>]> are missing completely or are into the <A[field|area]> of the solidarity referred.
Fourthly: The charter - and that is especially important for me - goes out from the indivisibility of the middle class and political human rights and social basic rights.
Colleagues, woman president, <M[<A[council|advice]> president]> taking office gentleman, worth, and colleagues! In my opinion this charter is only the <U[x-te]> demonstration of the ability of the union to produce again and again <A[importance|meaning]>-empty texts and letters of intent.
The representative of the court of justice gave already to recognize, that one will <A[make|let]> from the charter be inspired, and the representative of the commission in the convent in Turin attaches juridical <A[importance|meaning]> to the document.
After the time of the market the hour of Europe of the rights came in this way maybe <A[at last|finally]>. The <A[concept|term]> of the citizens is a relatively new <A[concept|term]> in the European Union.
The charter is in fact written as a text, the legally binding effect can show.
With pride I can also state that a representative of my fraction played a very important role in my native country, Mr <U[Gunnar Jansson]>, during the <A[adquisition|working out]> of this charter.
How I said already yesterday evening, and I do this today once again, <A[consist|exist]> in this respect union-wide still too many shortcomings. So we do always not succeed in our bothering around <U[justitielle]> and police cooperation in eliminating certain side effects of the <M[crime abatement]> and preventing that innocents become passive <A[victim|sacrifice]> in this case.
Woman president, the draft of the resolution of the European parliament for the <M[basic right charter]> is based on the same <A[problem|unclearness]> as the <A[works|jobs]> of the committee.
The Italian <A[Constitution|State]> plans the <A[border|boundary]> of the morality for the example, and the <M[human rights convention]> the <A[border|boundary]> of the rights of others and/or the public order.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! During the present vote at 12 o'clock we finish a <A[process|trial]> which began in 1984 in which already a <A[declaration|explanation]> of the rights was demanded, and which was continued in 1989 with the resolution <U[De Gucht]> when this parliament accepted the draft of the contract <A[over|above|about]> the European Union.
The charter will have consequences, whether it is anchored in the contract or not.
That is to be welcomed and not feared how Mr <U[Bonde]> seems to think.
Apparently the century closing in, with all <A[his|its]> fights for the liberation of the social classes put at a disadvantage, passed by in vain and nothing taught to us.
The charter fills a gap in the <M[EC right]> and <A[intensifies|supports]> the protection of the individual opposite the European police, opposite the authorities that oppose trickery as well as the <M[competition authorities]>.
The refusal, however, that is justified with the incompleteness of the charter, I can not understand.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, I can leave, where Mr <U[Gahrton]> stopped.
Allow me a third side-note for the rights of citizens of third countries.
The Council of Europe gained next to the court of justice for human rights also extensive experiences with such forms of the supervision on which we can build up.
Faced with the text of the charter to which we will give our approval today - as I hope, with <A[great|tall]> majority -, it is manifest that we will reach more and a more up-to-date <M[basic right protection]> with our charter than the <A[entry|joining]> to the European <M[Human Rights Convention]> would have produced it.
Therefore it is to keep on striding ahead necessary.
I believe that we must pursue this <A[objective|destination|purpose]> if we want to reach the necessary support for the charter through the citizens of Europe.
<A[According to|After]> <A[their|her]> <A[assumption|acceptance]> through this parliament I will use the <M[basic right charter]> for this report as an <M[analysis <A[pattern|scheme]>]>, and as far as my personal intellectual possibilities and the staff <A[means|resources|funds]> set to me for the <A[decree|disposal]> allow it it, I will carry out an analysis of the <A[compliance|keeping]> of the charter subdivided according to rights and countries in the fifteen member countries of the union.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, Mr <U[Minister]>, my ladies and gentlemen representatives! The commission would like to follow first of all the words from president <U[Moscovici]> and acknowledge the essential contribution of the members of the European Parliament to the debate in the convent and in this case in particular the role of Mr <U[Mendes de Vigo]> that he played in the executive committee of the convent during the <A[preparation|design|development]> of the <M[basic right charter]>.
I would like to pay attention only to some of the most prominent points of this debate.
The convent stipulated basic rights which result from the <A[single|individual]> <M[right instruments]> of the Council of Europe, the contracts and the <A[constitutions|states]> of the member states.
<A[According to|After]> the agenda the common pronunciation follows <A[about|over]> following two reports:
<A[With|In the case of]> the present state of the things our parliament also has to explain the Turkish nation that there are at the present time at least three <A[preconditions|prerequisites]> for <A[his|its]> <A[entry|joining]>.
Such conditions could not have been put furthermore only through decision of the parliament.
Of that I took the ideas done by gentlemen <U[Morillon]> for the <A[preconditions|prerequisites]> for the <A[entry|joining]> of Turkey for the knowledge which earn great interest.
I am to be able to say that the Turkish government in the meantime acknowledged this <M[<A[entry|joining]> partnership]> as a basis for the further cooperation so that we can have an entitled hope happy, to achieve exactly what we wanted to achieve, to help the <M[reform strengths]> indeed with our <A[politics|policy]> in Turkey, to give new swing to the <M[reform <A[process|trial]>]> and to drive <A[it|him]> forward in the regard onto the targeted <A[membership|affiliation]> in the European Union.
The most Important for me is, that to Helsinki in Turkey, in the Turkish public a debate <A[about|over]> the conditions of an <A[entry|joining]> of Turkey to the <U[EU]> has been caused aus, a debate that supports and requires the <M[reform strengths]> of the country.
There is this text for you for the comment.
Now it is a question of giving a necessary impulse for a future <A[entry|joining]>.
Nevertheless I would request of the Turkey urgently - I do not know how the vote ends -, to take also this question seriously.
The European Parliament will support <A[actively|acting]> the <A[photo|reception]> and <A[care|maintenance]> from relationships with the political parties, the <U[NRO]> and the press and makes an effort for an improvement of <A[their|her]> difficult and occasionally tightened <A[relation|proportion|relationship]> to the Large National Assembly.
Colleague <U[Morillon]>, your report is in my opinion realistic and responsible expressed.
On the occasion of your visit in Turkey in the March you called the problem of the Kurdish population today in the same way at least still with names.
It shows at the same time great naivety and great arrogance, to accept, that the Europeans the Turks to one - I quote - "radical change in <A[their|her]> habits and <A[theirs|hers]> mentalities" move can.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, worth colleagues and colleagues! The present report gives me great worry.
Recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000) of Mr <U[Duff]> and Mr <U[Voggenhuber]> in the name of the committee for constitutional questions to the <A[assumption|acceptance]> of the draft of the charter of the basic rights of the European Union (4487 / 1 / 00 - C5-0570 / 2000 - 2000 / 2233 (<U[AVC]>))
In Any Case we must make ourselves conscious on the next occasions on which we discuss about the power of the data processing, that a more fine-meshed and control thus offering the citizen more legal security is necessary.
<U[Empfehlung Duff]> / <U[Voggenhuber]> (A5-0325 / 2000)
We would like to emphasize following points:
The rights contained in the charter are anchored in the national <A[constitutions|states]> already and are defended by the national parliaments which stand the nations and <A[their|her]> cultures near.
1 that <A[plans|provides]>: "Collective expulsions are not permissible", not defined, that this <A[prohibition|ban]> can be exposed to the public order in wartimes or in cases of <A[difficult|hard]> troubles. In article 52 Abs.
We will give a short explanation about these three reasons in this <A[precedence|sequence]> subsequently.
The right of a government to the arbitrary annulment of <A[their|her]> own <A[constitution|state]> is labeling for a tyranny.
However today we were all proud as I would like to repeat <A[reason|bottom|ground]> on how we mastered this <A[significant|important]> stage for Europe.
A <A[society|company]> that knows only rights not however duties, becomes an egoistic society.
On that our fight is with first priority done so that the announced basic rights are concretized <A[about|over]> the political decisions.
The procedure of the convent is very much indeed interesting and efficient for the <A[adquisition|working out]> of a <M[base text]> which requires a <A[wide|broad]> consensus, however, withdrawing the possibility to the change and <A[supplement|complement]> of the text from the European parliament as representation of the European nations does not justify in any manner.
This charter must be improved, and our parliament must suggest a strategy to <A[their|her]> update and enrichment.
Therefore it should not be concluded on the council meeting in Nice and proclaimed, but from the peak the impulse should be given for a European debate <A[about|over]> the charter.
Fortunately it seems to walk the way of the reason along, that is to accept a charter with a field of application political in that and not obligatory to predominate the <A[tendency|trend]> near the national governments.
Of the peak of Cologne as "committee" describe, this has itself even too this "convent" proclaim, a <A[concept|term]> that reminds in fatal manner of 1793 and the outgrowths of the French revolution in the form of the terror to be accounted for by another convent.
On the other hand the used procedure, the exclusions carried out and the <A[problem|unclearness]> with regard to the character of this text fling a clear light onto the totalitarian new ones at <U[dasätze]>, that already in the <A[core|kernel]> of the European <M[integration <A[process|trial]>]> are available.
Fortunately the European parliament has only a consultative function in this <A[field|area]> up to the full <A[application|use]> of the <U[Amsterdamer]> contract, however, it finds <A[means|resources|funds]> and ways to use so these that correct decisions are delayed.
The opinions <A[about|over]> the kind and manner, however, diverge.
That was a century ago like this, and after it had been pushed a little into the background, it moved now again fully and very into the foreground.
What we do not want onto any case at all, those ones are possibilities that allow delinquents to reach through the back door onto the home market.
We approve in the same way of the establishment of a future <M[cooperation place]> to the support of the abatement of the organized crime and the <M[money laundry]> as well as the different suggested measures for the reaching of these <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]>.
That is, a <A[provisional|temporal|temporary]> place of the <U[justitiellen]> cooperation is fit out, that from a representative each of the prosecution, judge and/or police officer with <U[staatsanwaltschaftlichen]> <A[authorities|authorizations]> of our 15 member states puts together.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! As a member of the Mixed Parliamentary Committee <U[EU-Türkei]> I deal <A[intensely|intensively]> with the <M[<A[entry|joining]> perspective]> of Turkey.
Also the behavior of Turkey on Cyprus is unacceptable.
We support, however, the <A[critical|crucial]> objection of the reporter <A[about|over]> the <A[absence|lack]> of an effective <A[assessment|judgment]> of the granting of credit through the <U[EIB]> and the lack at transparency and corresponding public control of the activities of the <A[bank|bench]>.
In spite of <A[their|her]> difference it was and the Turkey is inseparable component of the European reality.
The <A[photo|reception]> of Turkey into the European Union became a question which is ever today more current then.
Mr <U[Morillon]> says Turkey is supposed to give not to consider the European Union as an excluding Christian club <A[effort|trouble]> that <A[they|she|it]> wants to exclude, Turkey.
Turkey will become a <A[real|genuine]> democratic state in the same way as it created the democratic Germany which we demanded the same thing from, when will have learned to live it with <A[their|her]> past, to live with <A[his|its]> past.
As soon as the government understood in Ankara that the status quo is not <U[hinnehmbar]> for Europe and the remaining world, great <A[progress|headway]> will be possible. The island can reunites and to be found a solution comprehensive, just, <A[durable|permanent]> and corresponding to the international law.
Why are all these questions not mentioned in the report of the European Commission?
In this balanced frame we must continue our work for the promotion of the approximation decidedly between the union and Turkey.
If you handle the Armenian question in the <A[connection|context]> with the <M[EU <A[entry|joining]>]> - you pay attention please, which I say: the Armenian question in the <A[connection|context]> with the <M[EU <A[entry|joining]>]> -, then the project will not start which we talked about today, that is so <A[simple|easy]>.
For this reason we supported also so very much after the first five years of the <A[conversion|transfer]> of the <M[Barcelona-<A[process|trial]>]> an upshot being drawn so that we are in Marseille in the situation to define the necessary orientations.
However we succeeded in maintaining the dialog and speaking also to sensitive topics as stability, terrorism, emigration, human rights.
The <A[council|advice]> was independent of that bothers, in particular since 1995, to provide for the <M[Mediterranean Sea <A[room|space]>]> of more extensive <A[means|resources|funds]> that are measured to the <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]> of the partnership for.
This is in fact an exceptionally important matter, and I would like to say that also as somebody who comes from Central Europe.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, as you know, there is in the English a phrase, <U[derzufolge]> a show without star as a <M[<U[Hamlet]> performance]> without the first grave digger is.
It is a question in this case of the <A[connection|combination]> of politics to <M[home market questions]> and a consensus for the introduction of the <M[origin cumulation]> <A[with|in the case of]> simultaneous end of subregional <M[free trade descendants]> between all partners and the takeover of the harmonized <A[protocols|minutes]> about the <M[origin cumulation]> for us.
We took as the knowledge also the <A[intention|purpose]> of the commission to give new swing to the <M[Barcelona-<A[process|trial]>]> with satisfaction.
I emphasized these aspects because the key is to be searched here for the <A[resuscitation|revival]> of the <A[process|trial]> and the political agenda must in addition be complemented by Barcelona.
Therefore our main task must be the <A[guarantee|warranty]> of the peace and the <A[security|safety]> of the European Union in the <M[Mediterranean Sea <A[room|space]>]>, and we must do everything <A[Standing|Being]> in our strengths, in this way this cooperation is put through and we say the promised <A[means|resources|funds]> on the basis of the ­ - egoistic generosity the European Union efficient are used.
These are <A[significant|important]> and <A[concrete|actual]> questions which I would like to ask, and I thank gentlemen for <U[Brok]>, which facilitated this debate immediately before the corresponding <A[consultations|discussions]> of the premiership and the commission <A[about|over]> these topics.
The world approaches one meanwhile unstoppable globalization, and in such scenario an organization is necessary in blocks big, acting on the gigantic field of the international competition as <M[main <A[protagonists|actors]>]>.
It is disappointing that the <M[Mediterranean Sea countries]> called up only just a quarter from the 4,7 billion euros in the <U[MEDA I-Programm]> which slowed down in 1999.
Therefore the <A[proposal|suggestion]> of the commission for a new impulse is positive, and we agree fully and very to the priorities which Mr <U[Patten]> named in <A[his|its]> <M[speech contributions]> and today afternoon strengthened here.
This is an alarm signal for the European Union, to play a by far more <A[active|acting]> role in the <M[Mediterranean Sea <A[room|space]>]> that enriches our European continent historically and culturally and strengthened it.
However, it is worse even that to the same <A[time|moment]> since we exchange now and then highly different points of view essentially in this house Palestinians are killed more and more.
<A[Help|Assistance]> for the reconstruction
We should not contribute the <A[means|resources|funds]>, however, in the December for the <A[conversion|transfer]> of this <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]>, we thresh then today empty straw.
We, however, may shut and not to want our eyes before the role that they played in this case, and that do the member states it is to be hoped neither.
The mass media in that <A[region|area]> were often responsible for the nonlocal tragedy; media are needed who act completely freely <A[according to|after]> the rules valid in our democracies.
I am a happy man also therefore because the parliament succeeded as I mean through stubborn pressure in turning a state which could not be referred to <A[just|precisely]> as favorable initially to the better one.
Once again: Unnecessary expenditure on unnecessary <A[meetings|sessions]> must really be avoided.
We must not focus our look to Kosovo only on that, however.
Also the circumstance, that some programs of the so called performance reserve have been assigned zu, this "<A[achievement|performance]> bound reserve", is regrettable.
In <U[Feira]> he awarded the status to the countries participated in the stabilization and association <A[process|trial]> as potential <A[applicants|candidates]> for the <A[entry|joining]>.
I refer again to the most main <A[aims|objectives]> of the <M[<U[CARDS]>-program]>: institutional <A[strengthening|refreshment]> in the sense of the democracy and the constitutional state, economical <A[development|evolution]> and reconstruction as well as regional cooperation.
It was correct that the European Union reacted to the <M[power takeover]> positively through president <U[Kostunica]>.
A first <A[consultation|discussion]> occurred on the 6th November.
Does the <M[<A[council|advice]> chairmanship]> propose which initiative in the sense of the demand of the European parliament in <A[his|its]> resolution of the 16th March 2000 to take in order to play a more <A[active|acting]> role so that the full and complete <A[conversion|transfer]> of the <M[<U[UN]> peace plan]> is guaranteed?
How can this <A[resuscitation|revival]> without the <A[regulation|arrangement]> of this conflict occur?
I can only export for this purpose that France and Germany - and here I do not speak more than <M[<A[council|advice]> president]> does - spoke to these questions on a bilateral summit conference last week in <U[Vittel]> and concluded the <A[education|formation]> of a team for the solution of this problem.
Simultaneously the union keeps on giving extensive <A[help|assistance]> to these two countries <A[about|over]> <A[their|her]> different programs, in particular <U[TACIS]>.
The premiership would like to take the question of the gentleman representative for the <A[reason|occasion]> to remove some <A[problems|unclearness]>.
<A[Make|Let]> me for the sake of the accuracy be added still: It is the request of both texts to support the legal frame for the abatement of the organized <M[tractor gangs]>.
In the report, that the Turkish Council of Ministers on the 21st September this year's than <M[reform program]> said goodbye, several <A[intentions|plans]> are contained in the section affecting the <M[law changes]>: <A[Photo|Reception]> of measures for the strengthening of the effective equalization of men and women in the social-pedagogic <A[field|area]> in the civil code; stronger abatement of <A[power|violence]> in the family; specific <M[family judge]> as well as <A[prohibition|ban]> of the possibility of a <M[<A[punishment|penalty]> <A[inheritance|reduction]>]> <A[with|in the case of]> crimes for reasons of the <M[honoring-<A[injury|violation]>]> improves <A[condemnation|conviction]> of these acts of violence through use.
The premiership does not have to give therefore any <A[answer|reply]> to that.
Next week a meeting of the <M[Europe conference]> will occur in France onto my invitation, that is with the <M[<A[entry|joining]> countries]>.
You believe, that the model Austria will be, bilateral indeed majority votes, in future an instrument in order to understand decisions at the European institutions past and to base a new institution and/or a new group here to be able to go around in the <A[council|advice]> around the unanimity?
The <A[council|advice]> was not dealt with this writing, however the premiership answered to gentlemen <U[Cem]> natural. The wording of this <A[answer|reply]> was sent to all member states.
And what does <A[it|he]> hold in the remaining one of the <A[statement|testimony]> of gentlemen <U[Cem]> - the current <M[<A[council|advice]> chairperson]>, Mr <U[Moscovici]>, did not answer that - in <A[his|its]> opinion the <M[Cyprus-question]> can not be considered at the further <A[treatment|handling|processing]> of the <M[<A[entry|joining]> partnership]> between Turkey and the European Union?
One must know, that the <M[<A[fishing|fishery]> <A[agreement|convention]>]> with Morocco is more far than a <A[simple|easy]> <A[agreement|arrangement]> on the fishing and that, should not be achieved this descendant as he knows a <A[deterioration|degradation]> of the relationships between the European Union and Morocco into the house <A[could|might]> stand.
Therefore I must bring my skepticism to the expression, which the result starts.
With regard to the <A[conversion|transfer]> of the basic principle of the <A[mutual|reciprocal]> recognition of judgments into <M[<A[punishment|penalty]> things]> according to the conclusions of the European <A[Council|Advice]> of <U[Tampere]> it is to be said that the <A[strengthening|refreshment]> of the cooperation between the member states, but also the protection of the individual rights is supposed to be facilitated in this way.
The additional questions must be set by other representatives.
In the remaining one the commission quits in that on the 4th October 2000 <A[communication|notification]> about the <M[oil supply]> of the European Union said goodbye at, that she will present a plan for energy savings and the diversification of the <A[energy carriers|power resources|sources of energy|sources of power]> that is supposed to help to strengthen the <M[energy efficiency]>, especially in buildings and in the traffic, to the European <A[Council|Advice]> of <U[Göteborg]>.
In this spirit we addressed on the occasion of the vote about the resolution for the embargo in the frame of the third committee of the general meeting of a company of the United Nations on the 9th November an <A[appeal|muster]> to cooperate with the international <M[human rights organizations]> without limit to the Cuban authorities.
It is therefore a thing of the NATO to <A[find|hit]> the precautions which she holds for necessary so that such incidents are not repeated.
(The <A[meeting|session]> is suspended at 18.55 and resumed at 21.00 o'clock. )
If one gives money, it is now the privilege of that one <A[which|who]> gives the money to define the political <A[aims|objectives]> very clearly, and the <A[superintendent|commissioner]> did that again and again.
<A[His|Its]> visit can set a sign and give a perspective to the <A[entire|whole]> <A[politics|policy]> that we pursue.
If we see in <A[it|her]> a <A[region|area]> in which political quarrels are absolutely possible, we are in the error.
And the second demand which is raised by the two reporters and must be supported by us all affects the regular consultation and information of the European Parliament.
The heads of the government underlined furthermore the determination of the union to <U[untersetzen]> this <A[process|trial]> through technical and economical <A[help|assistance]>.
It was the parliament which supported the <A[proposal|suggestion]> of the commission for the creation of a European agency for the reconstruction.
As the house white, we do not hold a corresponding explicit reference for necessary in the <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]>.
The vote occurs tomorrow at 11.30 o'clock.
For the cooperation <U[Asien-Europa 2000]> the participants arranged an enlarged one and updated <U[Rahmen]> which forms the work programme for the coming decade.
I think that that reminds us in Europe of which <A[importance|meaning]> we have for Asia and not only indeed with respect to economy and <A[trade|commerce]>. Although at this place people should refer to the recovery of <A[his|its]> economical situation and other of the fact having to owe Asia that we held word and our markets suited Asiatic exports openly also in the last two years.
I believe, that was a very good political confession, however we have still some problems there.
As is generally known the commission takes <U[ASEM]> extremely seriously, and we support the commission concerning that also fully and very.
It is necessary to improve the existing mechanisms for the <A[conversion|transfer]> into the <M[community right]> in order to increase the legal security and to overcome the present <A[slow|sluggish]> speed.
Therefore <A[it|she]> should support the creation of new regional organizations and begin it in this case, where there is already a presence of the community, as in the western and southern Pacific.
That is the assumption for a truly lasting <M[<A[fishing|fishery]> economy]>.
I believe that the future of the <A[fishing|fishery]> depends on these organizations in international waters and all efforts of the commission, Mr <U[Kommissar]>, are still too small. In order to defend the attitude of the <U[UN]>, both in the convention of 1982 and in the one here mentioned of New York, we must have a very <A[active|acting]> presence in these organizations for the benefit of a responsible <A[fishing|fishery]>.
Therefore I also think that an especially important role is attributed to the commission here. She should call the fishermen for the cooperation and suggest solutions which we all can agree to.
In addition the commission has to take over also every <A[amount|crowd|lot]> of tasks in the <A[connection|context]> with negotiations that must be led in the frame of the regional <M[<A[fishing|fishery]> organizations]>.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, I have the same problem as Mr <U[Nicholson]>, only much acuter.
So far therefore the proposals for solution of the <M[agriculture committee]>.
Sometimes we <A[wondered|asked]> even already to what extent even maybe the cyclical <M[<A[sale|heel|paragraph]> crisis]> is activated by the speculation of the mentioned company structures that safeguards the control of the sector in this <A[way|manner]> according to <A[their|her]> interests.
The additional <M[EU aid]> which is suggested in the report <U[Garot]> is according to my <A[opinion|view]> unreasonable in a time in which with the agenda 2000 and the imminent <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> with central and east Europe the reform of the <A[agrarian policy|agricultural policy]> <A[stands|is]> on the agenda.
I almost hold it for a brilliant performance, that of the reporters put down here, that one shows what one can do with administration if one pursues a certain <A[aim|objective]>, and that one is clearly set here.
On the one hand the tallest producers and/or those ones <A[which|who]> are integrated with subordinate <A[companies|operations]> would keep themselves away from this instrument and give the advantage to the systems which they already have: individual saving, bank loan, <M[<A[compensation|balance]> <A[cash|cash box]>]>.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, Mr <U[Kommissar]>, my dear ladies and gentlemen! <A[Make|Let]> me say at the beginning now that I welcome fundamentally the <A[proposal|suggestion]> of the commission to establish an equalization fund also in the sense of the Austrian agriculture.
I would like to thank the reporter for <A[his|its]> report.
According to the hearing one wants some marketing regulations for the <M[<A[intense|intensive]> animal keeping]> and a <A[disassembly|removal]> of the <A[agrarian policy|agricultural policy]>, provided that <A[they|she|it]> <A[ground|bottom]>-dependent, <A[ground|bottom]>-dependent production is.
There are the <M[pig marketing regulations]>, and we should not make the <A[error|mistake]>, to question the existing <M[pig marketing regulations]> that functions fundamentally.
In the view of the commission it is justified to subject only the farmers that join the equalization fund also of a discipline, because these get a certain <M[<A[income|revenue]> <A[guarantee|warranty]>]> as a return service while others that do not join are not getting this <M[<A[income|revenue]> <A[guarantee|warranty]>]>.
(The <A[meeting|session]> is closed at 23.10 o'clock. )
The gains being based on the value added tax <A[define|form]> 36 % and the traditional own resources 15 % of the total amount.
A further component of the reform that corresponds to a large extent to a <U[prioritären]> <A[field|area]> shown from the <A[yard|court]> affects the increased significance of the result and success measurement of priorities set to the <M[resource assignment]> within a system <A[according to|after]> possible specification and clear defined, measurable <A[objectives'|destinations'|purposes']>.
That is good so, and I would like myself with you, Mr <U[Karlsson]>, with the members of the court of auditors and also <A[with|in the case of]> the services of the court of auditors very cordial thank, that you support the reform of the commission so with your report.
I hope now very much for this <A[proposal|suggestion]> not simply being shelved on the <M[government conference]> in Nice or being turned under the carpet but that one deals with that seriously.
The reality, so as <A[it|she]> is described in the annual report, is rather sobering.
The number of the occurred <A[errors|mistakes]> is too high, than that such a guarantee <A[could|might]> be taken over.
The amount for <A[high|cheer]> and civil engineering <A[works|jobs]> was applied around 240 million too low.
I <A[could|might]> imagine the report of the court of auditors in an also a little more user-friendly way, complemented with <A[unequivocal|unambiguous]> recommendations, e.g. one or two per chapter.
In 1995 an <A[accord|agreement]> over the protection of the financial interests of the communities was decided on.
The commission and the member states should consider <A[it|him]> in this light and use the results of the report for the improvement of the administration of the financial <A[means|resources|funds]> of the European Union as an instrument.
I am conscious that this report and the <A[work|job]> of the parliament in the frame of the pending <M[<A[discharge|release]> procedure]> will contribute to greater vigilance in the regard onto the <M[community <A[editions|costs]>]>.
And now, woman president, I would be silent gladly and wait for somebody coming from the <A[council|advice]> to us.
The court of auditors did not do just the same any <A[exact|precise]> <A[information|specifications]> over that, where then the described <A[errors|mistakes]> occurred now, as in the last years.
Woman president! The <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> the European Union <A[awaits|approaches]>, and in the report of the court of auditors is clarified, that also in the <M[<A[applicant|candidate]> countries]> another <A[amount|crowd|lot]> is to be done.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, dear colleagues and colleagues! We <A[found|hit]> recently an <A[accord|agreement]> with the court of auditors <A[with|in the case of]> which it was possible for that whether we can already before completely receive advance information for the secret <U[Kämmerchen]> from the <M[court report]>, and agreed also on actually our preserving silence <A[about|over]> that.
Also I would like to turn to the <A[council|advice]> and ask the question, for which the decision on articles 24 of the <M[budget order]> is still pending.
Maybe some healthy human intellect can contribute from the European Union to the solution of the problem and to provide <U[George Bush]> with <A[his|its]> <A[lawful|legitimate]> place in the <A[history|story]>, that indeed in the <M[garbage basket]>!
It is not our task to make scapegoats <U[ausfindig]> neither in our institutions, still in our states.
. (<U[EN]>) I am pleased with the members of the parliament thinking that the situation was more satisfactory in the regard onto the procedure to the <A[presentation|pattern|submission]> of the annual report in the parliament and in the committee for budgetary control than in the previous years.
We will have, however, occasion to talk about all points.
If it is relevant from the point of view of the tester, we name all facts which must be named.
My ladies and gentlemen Delegated! As you might have noticed, the last part of the <M[speech contribution]> of the gentleman president the court of auditors through a fatal virus was influenced which crept into <A[his|its]> contribution and this High House.
Some amendments as Nr. 1 and 18 are connected to questions that affect before all Great Britain, and it must be noticed that all representatives of Great Britain, from the <A[factions|fractions]> of the socialists, the people's party and the <A[greens|Green Party]>, have defended <A[they|she|it]> with large vehemence, and they were accepted in the <M[environmental committee]>.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! We accepted the guideline in the March of this year above <A[cable railways|ropeways]> for the passenger traffic.
We think that in these cases the <A[trade|commerce]> must not be burdened with the <M[manufacturer duties]> of the <M[product safety law]>.
We <U[vernommen]> the reasons for these <A[requests|applications]> and for the resumption of the arguments of the industry which were expressed in the committee.
It should suffice if the <A[sales assistant|seller|vendor]> can give the buyer general information about the products and points out the missing information and <A[documents|pads]> to this.
Definitive still small a request onto the European commission to article 4 concerning the European <A[norms|standards]> and the question whether these must be published.
The exceptions being valid for <M[sale <A[facilities|institutions]>]> of <M[benevolence organizations]> and non-profit <A[facilities|institutions]> as well as the <M[exception <A[regulations|arrangements]>]> for <U[Gebrauchtwaren]> sold on markets or from the trunk are welcomed by me.
To increase that reliability of the product safety and the customer service the value of the European label in one special difficult and direction-pointing moment.
If we ask at other place the commission to present a <A[proposal|suggestion]> for the <A[security|safety]> of services in near future, so is not to see, why we are supposed to control the aspects of the services here now with and want instead of waiting for the <A[proposal|suggestion]> of the commission. Because it emerges already now that <M[delimitation difficulties]> will occur between the <A[single|individual]> <A[regulations|arrangements]> and that the <M[right insecurity]> will increase in the <A[race|course|running]> of the time.
I would like to explain the emphases of this <A[proposal|suggestion]> shortly.
We facilitate now also the opening of the system for third countries, in particular for the <M[<A[entry|joining]> <A[candidates|nominees]>]>: We simplified the procedures for the realization of <U[Sofortmassnahmen]> on <M[community level]> so that we can become immediately <A[active|acting]> <A[according to|after]> the recommendation of a <M[<A[regulation|arrangement]> committee]>.
Through this new <A[definition|purpose]> no essential additional responsibility is imposed on these <A[shops|shutters]>.
The <A[proposal|suggestion]> in amendment 11, that replace word "manufacturer" through "Service renderer of a service" to, no <A[clearness|clarity]> would create, but would <A[rather|earlier]> bring about confusion, there the guideline no definition for that one Begriff "Service renderer of a service" enthaelt.
The commission approves indeed the rapid establishment of such a net, nevertheless this must still be synchronized between the member states.
Such certification can be brought in as a proof, <A[it|she]> does not offer, however, any one hundred percent <A[security|safety]>.
I explained now <A[detailed|full]>, why the commission the amendments 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28 to 30, 32, 33, 36 to 34 and a part of the amendment 7, as well as the second part of the amendment 21 and the first part of the amendment 27 and 34 refuses. The commission approves however the amendments 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31 and 35 as well as a part of the amendment 7, the first part of amendment 21 and the second part of the amendments 27 and 34, there the being there <A[proposal|suggestion]> the commission through these amendments is improved and keeps more <A[clearness|clarity]>.
Obviously one must not belong to the <A[faction|fraction]> of the Social-Democratic Party of Europe in the view of Mr <U[Crespo]> as an Italian socialist.
After my estimation no <A[contradiction|discrepancy]> exists between amendment 12 and amendment 37.
With regard to the <A[precedence|sequence]> I leave the decision with the president, at which I, however, remind of my being in every case against all three amendments.
The <M[Mediterranean Sea countries]> not belonging to the <U[EU]> have to fight with respect to the economical <A[development|evolution]> with especially serious problems <A[beyond doubt|certainly]>. There are tensions due to the regional <A[inequalities|dissimilarities]> over there <A[constantly|permanently]>.
Concerned something the <A[respect|attention|caution]> of the dignity of the legal immigrants, also instruments to the financial support of all those <A[young people|adolescents]> must be created so in the sense of a harmonized European <M[immigration <A[politics|policy]>]> next to suitable <M[right instruments]> for the backup of a just <A[treatment|handling|processing]> of these immigrants, the ones too <U[derückkehren]> after the completion of a compartment or <A[college|university]> study in the European countries into <A[their|her]> country of origin want in order to incorporate a job there.
I would like to emphasize a factor, that I hold for real determining in this question: the missing equality on the labor market.
. (<U[PT]>) Late, however nevertheless nor the commission did not present now the program that distinguishes from former programs and particularly from the 4th <A[general-purpose program|skeleton program]> running out at the end of this year strikingly for the support of the <M[frame strategy]> of the community for the equalization from women and men (2001 ­ 2005).
To one many suggestions for improvement of my <A[faction|fraction]> were considered. To the other one studies were demanded that pay attention to the situation of the women in the national labor markets and the inadequate <A[access|entrance]> to the <M[insurance systems]> which we need statistics with meaningful, sex-related data for.
. (<U[EN]>) My Party has fatal reservations against the <A[application|use]> of the <M[community right]> to the sale of commodities instead of the <A[application|use]> of the <A[draft|plan]> of the <A[mutual|reciprocal]> recognition of standards.
Now one understands it, and the changes brought in by <U[Labour]> offer the <A[guarantee|warranty]>, that the <A[shops|shutters]> of <M[benevolence organizations]> remain untouched and are excluded from the guideline.
Amendment 15 finally lets the commission free hand during the <M[language <A[regulation|arrangement]>]> in the agency, what of our opinion represents a <A[development|evolution]> worrying very much.
The simplification of the <M[decision procedure]>, the <A[equipment|institution]> of decentralized <M[<A[use|commitment|insertion]> centers]> (not only in <U[Pristina]>, what of <A[his|its]> detachment would amount from Yugoslavia) and the solution of the problem of the double structure with <M[administration <A[council|advice]>]> and <M[administration committee]> <A[could|might]> prove to be positive measures in the direction of the elimination of the considerable administrative shortcomings within the European agency for the reconstruction.
We vote therefore against the <A[proposal|suggestion]> of the commission and the report of the parliament.
An adaptation of the existing <M[community <A[regulations|arrangements]>]> in this <A[field|area]> can therefore than entitled are looked.
Further the fund offers the possibility that in the form of the cofinancing through the member states more or less concealed state aids are given.
. (EL) in Spite of <A[his|its]> serious shortcomings the report <U[Morillon]> goes <A[unequivocally|unambiguously]> wider than the <A[proposal|suggestion]> of the commission for the <M[<A[entry|joining]> partnership]> between the European Union and Turkey.
We <A[voted|tuned]> on the other hand against that.
We must acknowledge just the same that Turkey did <A[progress|headway]> in some <A[fields|areas]> and that positive signals are to be noted as the reporter must.
Our parliament has supported already since 1987 this recognition, and the discharge of this amendment is a proof of the coherence of the parliament in this question.
The union must make more <A[concrete|actual]> <A[proposals|suggestions]> and design the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> as a vital geopolitical strategy around Turkey.
Such ulterior motives are not worthy to Europe and to the Turkey.
Since several years I can observe the working method of one of these regional organizations, the <U[NAFO]> (Organization for the <A[fishing|fishery]> in the <U[Nordwestatlantik]>), as a member of the delegation for the relationships to Canada, to which the states of this <A[region|area]>, under that also Canada, belong, as well as all those ones that use traditional fishing zones in this <A[region|area]> as <A[about|for instance]> France, Spain and some other European countries.
<A[It|She]> is not satisfied before, when <A[their|her]> own <M[gunboat fleet]> puts through <A[their|her]> <M[<A[fishing|fishery]> <A[politics|policy]>]> under the <M[star <A[circle|ring]> banner]>.
The most important thing does not consist therefore in satisfying the <M[hegemony <A[aspiration|tendency]>]> of the commission when one weakens the European position, which would completely contradict a proper <A[conversion|transfer]> of the <M[subsidiarity principle]>.
Finally a final result which deserves to be defended was achieved after tough negotiations.
With this <A[proposal|suggestion]> which is aimed at the replacement of three guidelines for the <M[waste combustion]> people strive therefore for correcting the quality of the air, the water, the <A[grounds|bottoms]> and the national health when one reduces the <A[emissions|issues]> of <M[dirt particles]> in connection with the combustion and the <U[Mitverbrennung]> and in particular the <A[emission|issue]> of dioxins, <U[Furanen]> and heavy metals.
I seem to be referred in addition important on the innovation that now not more only of <A[emissions|issues]> into the air, but also into the water and into the <A[ground|bottom]> the speech is.
During the <A[treatment|handling|processing]> the draft was improved.
Also the introduction of by far more <A[severe|austere]> <M[nitrogen oxide limit values]> at new <U[Mitverbrennungsanlagen]>, as for example <M[cement <A[stoves|ovens]>]>, a step forward is also that will offer a stimulus for the reduction of the <A[emissions|issues]> when the suggested <A[norms|standards]> are reflected not <A[just|precisely]> the most modern state of the art.
Admired representatives! You excuse especially you, Mr <U[Blokland]>, that I was late around some minutes.
Definitively I would like to say that this guideline is an essential contribution to the reduction of the negative consequences for the environment and the risks for the human health.
It would be to be charged to the European Parliament highly, when it in the name the For <U[derückweisung]> any discrimination, the abatement of the exclusion and would lend under observation of the responsibility of the individual of the introduction of a system new impetus, that facilitates the <A[concrete|actual]> <A[conversion|transfer]> of the essential <M[solidarity principle]>.
Great differences are to be found by country to country, however, and detailed and <A[comparable|corresponding]> statistical <A[information|specifications]> that give information about that reliably are missing, which system where in which <A[way|manner]> produces the best results, in what <A[his|its]> weaknesses <A[consist|exist]> and so forth. For now this reason that the commission publishes before the <A[determination|definition]> of any of universal rules for the <M[addition health insurance]> a <M[green book]> in which all these scattered data and the corresponding information are compiled and are evaluated the necessity is underlined in my comment written in the name of the committee for economy and currency.
Up to now this was in a way a <M[taboo topic]>.
The danger that citizens not very healthy and citizens and older people because of <A[their|her]> high risk can <A[make|let]> themselves be insured only relatively privately is not <A[portable|acceptable]> for the <M[society <A[development|evolution]>]>.
The second <A[draft|plan]> which the reporter explains in <A[his|its]> introduction and which is supported by many colleagues contains the promotion of the necessary rules and <M[behavior codices]> for the introduction of forms of the <A[mutual|reciprocal]> assumption of costs between the insurers <A[who|which]> guarantee the <A[preparation|supply]> of qualitatively high-quality <M[supply services]> to all of them and <A[who|which]> counteract the dangers of the formation of discriminating practices and a risk and customer selection.
In my opinion it can not be correct that it is dependent on the money who <A[stands|is]> on the waiting list <A[above|up]>.
The new <A[proposal|suggestion]> of the committee for <A[employment|activity|occupation]> and social matters to do at first an inventory in the form of a <M[green book]> and to decide then whether we need a guideline or a recommendation first is correct.
In the Netherlands people discuss currently about changes of structure of the system.
On this <A[basis|element]> the commission should take an initiative and articulate <A[concrete|actual]> corners as guidelines for the <M[health systems]> of the member states.
There can probably not be an absolute <M[<A[unit|unity]> solution]> therefore for the insurance.
Therefore I mean, we should Mr <U[Rocard]> for <A[his|its]> report, in which <A[it|he]> asks the commission for a service, a <M[green book]>, that allows us an <A[insight|view]> into the current state of the insurances in the member states and simultaneously the control status for the future, congratulate and agrees to <A[it|him]> with regard to the contents.
They both base themselves on a <M[three column model]>: to that state, to the company internal one and to the private one.
With regard to the <M[addition pensions]> the European Union elaborated already certain <A[regulations|arrangements]>. She presented a <M[green book]> which then the draft of a guideline followed from for that.
. (<U[EN]>) Mr <U[Präsident]>! I would like to thank Mr <U[Rocard]> and him congratulate on <A[his|its]> report, and I congratulate also gentlemen <U[Marinos]> on the comment of <A[his|its]> committee.
This study can be then the <A[basis|element]> for a <A[communication|notification]> of the commission onto the <A[council|advice]> and the European Parliament in which initiatives or measures are suggested.
With regard to the amendments submitted by the <M[budget committee]> I can inform delightedly that they all were taken over.
We agreed to the key data of the program, to which the multidimensional tackling of the phenomenon count, the measures in the <A[fields|areas]> of health, <A[education|formation]> and apartment, the coherence and <U[Komplementarität]> to other, bordering <M[political fields]> as well as the <A[participation|share]> of the government-independent <A[carriers|straps]>, in the same way, however, also the people's themselves affected from the social exclusion.
That is, that we must use the cyclical <M[growth phases]> in order to create a balance or a surplus.
Here I remind only of the last <M[<U[ECOFIN]>-<A[council|advice]>]> <A[just|precisely]> to incorporate this long-term aspect of the public finances from the coming year with respect to the aging of the population into the evaluation requesting of the commission.
One of the positive features of the program of the Netherlands is the special <A[consideration|regard]> - as I said at the beginning - of the effects of the <A[aging|maturation]> of the population on the <A[national budget|national finances|state budget]> of the coming years.
Therefore the <M[budget <A[bill|calculation]>]> makes a surplus of one and a half points of the gross domestic product for the year 2000 near Germany.
If we add still the <M[exchange rate <A[development|evolution]>]> of the euro to the dollar, we have a clear negative effect in the regard onto the inflation.
People keep on striving for bringing a public <M[<A[apportionment|allocation]> system]> with private <M[accumulation of capital systems]> in tune, and they are obviously compatible also with supports for the creation of specific <A[investment funds|mutual funds]> which can receive long-term <A[tax allowances|tax benefits|tax privileges]> and maybe are helpful to the population at the solution of the problem of the aging.
The third results from that, us leading basic principle, the <M[<A[provision|precaution]> principle]> indeed.
Must be reminded of several <A[proposals|suggestions]> being currently discussed for <M[right rules]> that all the efficiency and the expediency of the shared <A[regulations|arrangements]> and will strengthen subsequently, as I hope, the confidence of the consumers.
But this relatively small <M[incidence <A[rate|installment]>]> is not a reason for the complacency.
Honestly said, I was disappointed, that in the <A[declaration|explanation]> of yesterday the community was not appreciated for the enormously positive role by prime minister <U[Jospin]> in the last years.
As a matter of course the increasing <A[appearance|manner|occurrence]> demands from <U[BSE]>, not only in France, but also in other member states, <A[according to|after]> <A[declarations|explanations]>.
The <M[veterinarian office]> of the commission dedicates already now highest priority to the controls, which affects the protective measures against <U[BSE]>, in the member states.
What <A[his|its]> <A[security|safety]> starts, so I would like to repeat that there is already a whole series of controls that guarantee that meat and bone flour does not represent any danger during the <A[transfer|transmission]> of <U[BSE]>.
Yes, one hardly likes to believe it, it lasted four years in order to agree to a measure that I take as basic for the protection of the national health.
Mr <U[Ratspräsident]>, I send a reminder expressly at, that the <A[council|advice]> announces <A[his|its]> opinion on the <M[<U[TSE]> <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]>]> <A[at last|finally]>.
In the current situation the only possibility to break the <A[circulation|cycle]> of the <M[<U[BSE]>-infection]> consists in completely forbidding the use of <M[animal flour]> in the feeding.
In this <A[connection|context]> I would like to mention that we presented from the <A[faction|fraction]> of the liberals an amendment which is accepted it is to be hoped.
The <A[politics|policy]> must cause changes here, in this way that are really taken from <A[persons responsible|persons in charge]> for this crisis into the duty and with <A[concrete|actual]> decisions a first step in the direction of the termination is done to this dramatic crisis.
They must be reconsidered therefore.
The marking decided on for <U[Rindfleisch]> <A[with|in the case of]> which it is a question of a <U[Mindestetikettierung]> that is not before since two and a half months in force does not facilitate any proper backtracking of the origin of the animals, and we forbade the specified <M[risk material]> much too late.
The citizens must be informed comprehensively of the features of the test mentioned by me.
Mr <U[Ratspräsident]>, then you did not undertake anything or almost anything, in the same way as your colleagues remained inactive faced with the effects of Chernobyl, the <M[Aids epidemic]> or the contaminated <M[blood products]>. As a <A[reason|bottom|ground]> it was indicated always it does not want to make the public one not panic.
The French <A[prohibition|ban]> will cause a massive <M[<A[need|requirement]> increase]>, however, the offer at this raw material is restricted.
The consumers lost <A[their|her]> confidence, and in order to stop this phenomenon, compulsory <M[<U[BSE]>-tests]> must be introduced for cattle and sheep.
Important one is now rather in the sense of the <M[commission <A[proposal|suggestion]>]> to work on <M[animal flours]> corresponding to the highest <M[<A[security|safety]> standards]>.
Otherwise I am - once ­ is never completely agreed on what the colleagues, Ms <U[Ainardi]>, Ms <U[Auroi]> and Ms <U[Grossetête]> said.
Because once rid, <A[council|advice]> and commission, you have a sufficient financial <A[basis|element]> and can carry out a vigorous <A[politics|policy]> now.
We must tackle this problem.
Woman president, Mr <U[Ratspräsident]>, Mr <U[Kommissar]>! I am very delighted to <U[vernehmen]> here in this hall that the <U[GAP]> at all costs is to be reworked.
We have the <A[grounds|bottoms]>, the suitable climate and the necessary <U[Know ­ how]> in order to replace <M[animal flour]> immediately by genetically not changed <M[plant proteins]>, and in spite of that we renounced the right to build on the <M[plant proteins]>, necessary for the feeding of our animals and the <A[feeding|nutrition]> of the population, on our own <A[grounds|bottoms]> while we are financing fallow lands simultaneously. For this reason our <A[faction|fraction]> submitted an amendment in which the <A[council|advice]> and the commission are asked to search for possibilities which represent a suitable substitute for <U[prionenhaltiges]> <M[animal flour]> and American gene-technically changed soya in order to increase the building of these <M[plant proteins]> again into Europe.
The food must guarantee the secure <A[feeding|nutrition]> of the human being.
I think it <U[vorbildhaft]> that France wrung itself in order to risk this step.
But the gentlemen do not help them!
Therefore I was amazed, that under these circumstances <U[Kadaver]> still uses and/or they may be used.
Recently the <M[<U[Phillips]>-investigation]> to <U[BSE]> was published in Great Britain.
I would like to suggest to the European Commission also to use the <M[<A[provision|precaution]> principle]> at beef from France.
We do still not have any certainty and must know therefore how the scientific <M[fact situation]> is and which measures are necessary.
In addition I took of course all <A[proposals|suggestions]> as the knowledge for which I am absolutely prone.
If citizens come from the member states and to me tell, the legislation did not become proper or completely not moved, we would have to think about that maybe again then, but it is not because the scientists say us necessary, but because it lacks the <A[compliance|keeping]> of the law in the European Union.
If one does not want to hear us, one does not invite us <A[first|only]> at all then at the best.
The commission thinks, that the <M[moving takeover descendants]> for the <A[purification|clarification]> and coordination of these measures play an important role, and currently the negotiations to the first <M[moving takeover descendants]> of the community with Russia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco run.
Which related <A[proposals|suggestions]> does the commission have on the basis of the article 31 of the <M[union contract]>?
(The president interrupts the speaker. )
The <A[objective|destination|purpose]> in this period was the <A[lowering|reduction]> of the public deficit for the reaching of a more satisfactory monetary policy, lower interests and a higher growth.
I always say that the euro is not imported on the 1st January 2002, we already in our <A[bag|pocket]> have <A[it|him]>; we have <A[it|him]> in different coin, but we carry <A[it|him]> in our <A[bag|pocket]>.
The valid limit values for nitrogen oxide and lead were not exceeded, neither the <M[ozone threshold value]> in the Athenian city according to guideline 92 / 72 / EC. It is, however, said that the measurements were taken in the midsummer.
Affects: A representative of the <M[general <A[management|head office]>]> competition of the European Commission represented state aids for the audiovisual sector On a <A[class|seminar]> of the French premiership on the topic <M[culture economy]> the opinion that the legal <M[investment <A[obligations|commitments]>]> imposed on the senders alone would represent state aids through their being stipulated by the legislator <A[compellingly|conclusively]>.
<A[It|She]> is to be respected and protected. "
However that does not happen by itself, because this new growth is expressed <U[inegalitär]> and can be accompanied as we observe in the USA since approximately a decade from continuous appearances of the insecurity, the exclusion, the poverty and the urban <M[ghetto <A[education|formation]>]>.
The governments of the member states did not accept this definition which a little too simply and too is meaningless.
In the rough climate arising in this case there are more and more people that can not keep up, are taken into the offside and are excluded.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, in this High House we very often hear, similarly a litany as the European <M[social model]> and/or the social <M[<A[marrow|pulp]> economy]> are praised, <A[which|who]>, so many mean, a contrast to the chaotic model of the United States of America would form.
(Technical <A[trouble|disturbance]>)
That is an enormous sum.
In addition all political levels must be involved.
I agree to that, that it is necessary to know the causes of the poverty better. I approve preventive measures by means of innovative and <A[concrete|actual]> <A[answers|replies]> under inclusion of the <A[parties engaged in labor negotiations|parties to wage agreements]>, the local and national administrations and the common action of the citizens against the exclusion as a consequence of alliances, adaptations and shifts of enterprises, rural exodus and too strong settlement of the urban <A[room|space]>.
We had a very interesting debate <A[about|over]> the role of the <A[employment|activity|occupation]> <A[with|in the case of]> the abatement of the social exclusion and the role of the social and structure reforms.
That is a juridical problem since in the wording of the contract only onto social exclusion and not on poverty <U[Bezug]> is taken.
These <A[proposals|suggestions]> are, I think, a pragmatic <A[answer|reply]> to your request.
But, approval for the strategy is absolutely not called approval for the detail.
If we define a clear, obligatory frame for the member states, the different systems which must suffice for these <A[requirements|requests]> should have a longer time of the probation.
The renewable energies will not be a panacea to the solution of this problem. But nobody doubts about their being able to contribute to <A[his|its]> <A[easing|alleviation]> and also to the diversification of the sources of energy as well as to the decrease of our dependence on the oil and natural gas in considerable measure which on the other hand would agree with us also well.
I want to repeat three of our demands.
The <A[determination|definition]> of realistic <M[target standard values]> can increase only the confidence of the citizens into the <M[energy <A[politics|policy]>]> to be pursued.
In my eyes a <A[consistent|logical]> <A[politics|policy]> has a <M[symbol effect]> in the <A[field|area]> of renewable energies for the future Europe.
With these <A[agreements|arrangements]> finally the member states of the European Union must prove that they will achieve a contribution to the attaining of the <M[Kyoto <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]>]>.
It would be regrettable if a category was excluded that can contribute to the <U[Erwirtschaftung]> of energy from <A[waste|drop]> in total it is for small projects or as a part of the <M[total <A[bill|calculation]>]>.
The <A[education|formation]> of <M[peat measure]> at the assimilation and <M[forest litter origin]> resembles that of other vegetable biomass.
I would like to inform Mr <U[Chichester]> of before my <M[home coast]> at sea already very modern <M[wind power plants]> being installed. It is a question of a project which in a certain way very much soon is put into operation.
The <A[dispute|argument]> about the <A[renunciation|sacrifice]> of nuclear power which is led among other things in Sweden and Germany showed that without visible <M[energy alternatives]> environment-friendly and to be realized for a competitive price the debate proceeds unavoidably in the sand.
Therefore the member states must make obligatory <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]>.
Therefore I am optimistic, which renewable <A[energy carrier|power resource|source of energy|source of power]> <A[concerns|starts]> the <M[future potential]> provided that the correct stimuli are created.
I believe, a lot of courage is required to position the renewable energy so also again and again as she earned it.
A very strong rise of the <M[oil price]> makes clear to us <A[beyond doubt|certainly]> with greater hardness the problems which are connected to our dependence on the fossil sources of energy.
Subsequently we can not accept amendment 28.
In this case <A[it|she]> pays attention very much, however, to the used <A[concepts|terms]> not representing any intervention in <A[their|her]> <M[initiative right]> and their not having to be <A[incompatible|irreconcilable]> with the <M[electricity home market]>.
In the commission for the reconstruction of Tajikistan, where 25 000 widows live, only a woman was among 26 participants.
Although the <M[woman part]> was up to now relatively small, studies proved that the presence leads to an improvement of the relationships with the population on site and the general morality from women in the peace-safeguarding troops of the <U[UN]>.
The report <U[Theorin]> goes in this <A[field|area]> in details and also in repetitions that we ask as a <A[faction|fraction]> of the European People's Party and the European democrats in the sense of an official document very much remove.
Politically spoken I can <A[rather|earlier]> interpret the present amendment 19 as tactical defeat and/or tactical <A[withdrawal|retreat]> because as a contents-related compromise evaluate, and that should be the <M[woman thing]> actually unworthy.
You were detained.
Also Portugal, where the women kept yes only after the <M[April revolution]> of 1974 <A[access|entrance]> to the diplomacy, proved recently with East Timor and our ambassadress in Indonesia, <U[Ana Gomes]>, how the role of a woman and <A[their|her]> sensitivity for the problems and the suffering of a nation that stood for 25 years in <A[his|its]> <M[freedom fight]> alone of the whole world and in particular here in the European Parliament can be perceived.
Up to now few of them only completely did this, two or three, as I hear.
Therefore also this dimension must be considered in future at the <U[Konzipierung]> of the <A[politics|policy]> of the European Union.
Unfortunately the terms are not defined, and no distinctions are found.
Send please the <A[council|advice]> our protest.
You are people with other experiences ­ experiences that are indispensable for the <M[political <A[leadership|management]>]> and in particular for the settlement of conflicts.
The pronunciation is closed.
Secondly: If the sector is supposed to be controlled by law, some points must be examined as a matter of course.
In the last weeks I stated that both on <A[pages|sides]> of international <M[trade union <A[circles|rings]>]> and near certain national trade unions great interest exists.
Second objection: Are you then also for housewives receiving a <A[remuneration|reward]>?
All those ones <A[who|which]> currently work blackly received then a <A[work|job]> under decent social conditions.
Moreover joined themselves also from this project resulting more often to already two to three families and a domestic help together started.
We were <A[just|precisely]> in a plenary session during the first <M[October meeting]> when we heard about the courageous reaction of the Serbian nation in our pronunciation <A[about|over]> the situation in Yugoslavia <U[woraufhin]> we immediately, you remind yourself, dear colleagues and colleagues, the cancellation of the international sanctions demanded.
In this way Europe proved the vitality of <A[his|its]> civilization in the world history and <A[his|its]> political <M[<A[creator|ladle]> strength]> during the organization of the future <M[<A[development|evolution]> way]>.
It must not give to any doubt about that that the question of the status of Kosovo is a democratic question.
On the other hand we would have gladly a chance to prove to Europe that we are in the situation to develop the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia from own strength and under recognition of the true principles of the democracy.
I must say that I was - when I spoke then with you - impressed by that expressed as you mastered this extremely difficult situation and as decided you were.
That is tidied up in the next <A[protocols|minutes]>, Mr <U[Watson]>.
The <A[access|entrance]> to documents and information about the activity of the institutions makes for the citizens possible, to pull the decision-making bodies for the responsibility and stimulates to more effectiveness.
The fifth important amendment is according to my <A[opinion|view]> that one for the annual <A[reporting|report]> particularly <A[about|over]> the documents which must remain secret or which are at least still secret.
This question is unclear, and the possibility that also <A[regulations|arrangements]> that restrict the transparency more strongly in force remain withstands it and among other things too we brought in amendments for this point.
The committee for foreign affairs, human rights, common <A[security|safety]> and <M[defense <A[politics|policy]>]> defends itself against the <A[proposal|suggestion]> documents, the foreign policy one or <M[<A[security|safety]> questions]> affect automatically and as a whole from the <M[public principle]> exclude.
If we want the citizens to really be able to perceive <A[their|her]> rights, we need in these <M[run places]> in particular trained employees who take the citizen searching information in a way at the hand and lead him through the complicated labyrinth of the institutions as a boy scout.
Registers are indispensable if we do not want an <M[insider-public]> to become from the public.
It is very pleasant that the parliament succeeded in creating a <A[wide|broad]> majority for more transparency.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! I would like to begin with expressing the reporters my thanks for <A[their|her]> very good <A[work|job]>.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! <A[Frankness|Openness]> and transparency in the European Union do not <A[stand|be]> in any good light.
Should be to that like this, that is a miscalculation then, because here it is a question of the plausibility and reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the citizens.
Under document one understands the most different things nowadays and we would like to guarantee an <A[access|entrance]> as comprehensive as possible to many <M[document types]> in different forms.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, the <A[attitude|setting]> of the commission for the <M[file <A[insight|inspection]>]> is obvious from the internal manual, that was distributed on the 11th October onto the employees of the commission and in which they are informed of how they are supposed to handle <A[requests|applications]> for <M[file <A[insight|inspection]>]> through <M[parliament members]>.
This regulation must be deleted or complemented at least with the duty of a weighing of interests.
The usual kind of the international cooperation with the diplomatic habits and <M[game rules]> - that e.g. everything ends behind shut doors - it is not up-to-date for modern <M[cooperation forms]> how they were developed by the <U[EU]>.
We should not confuse <A[it|him]> with the role of the European Parliament or with future interinstitutional <A[agreements|arrangements]>.
A step forward to the demands of the right of the citizen was put on information and knowledge.
However, he is not the only one, that I would like to express my thanks, also <U[Hanja Maij-Weggen]> of the <U[PPE-DE-Fraktion]>, who is a coauthor of the report due to the consolidated <M[<U[Hughes]> procedure]>, deserves some great thanks.
The transparency must become a keystone indeed of the activity of the <A[entire|whole]> European Union, nevertheless the right to be able to take <A[insight|inspection]> into the documents does not suffice for the realization of the transparency only yet.
The European Parliament demands therefore that the European <A[security|safety]> and defense <A[politics|policy]> is integrated into the structures of the European Commission in the future.
When president <U[Prodi]> turned to the parliament on the 3rd October, <A[it|he]> spoke of the institutional triangle and it referred to that that in a European system being based on controls and <M[same weights]> the smooth functioning of every institution contributes to the common interest.
I must admit that the great challenge is the <A[exact|precise]> <A[determination|definition]> of the documents in this <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]>.
I would like to emphasize that the commission to the given <A[time|moment]> <A[could|might]> accept practically the entirety of the amendments as Nr.
In some cases I would vote gladly for the <A[proposals|suggestions]> of the commission, and for that the representatives would have to have the list with the amendments which the commission can support, and with the amendments which <A[it|she]> does not want to support in the hand.
Own resource of <A[credit institutions|credit institutes]>
Finally, and that was the most controversial point, the committee demanded <U[vehement]> a procedure sped up for the <A[conversion|transfer]> of this <M[right regulation]>.
These changes go onto the place of several other <A[proposals|suggestions]> of the report which are probably refused during the vote and now replaced by the new changes which are the result of this consensus.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! Faced with the excellent voting result for this report and the <A[answer|reply]> of the commission this morning it is very obvious - if you consider all parts which we voted on - that we should move the vote <A[about|over]> the draft of the legislative resolution according to article 69 paragraph 2, around to be able to enter successful negotiations with the commission and the <A[council|advice]>.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! I regret to have said that also the <A[faction|fraction]> of the European People's Party and the European democrats (<U[PPE-DE]>) approves the postponement of the vote, but I must refer to your coordinator to me coming in order to inform me that also you wanted to postpone the vote up to the session November <U[II]>, instead of voting this evening.
I would suggest a shift of the vote for another reason - Mr <U[Göbbels]> already said it - that is a very important matter.
I do not know what costs a roll call vote, but it is <A[secure|sure]> some a Thousand Francs or Belgian francs from our budget.
I know that in France whole herds were slaughtered, and that does not seem to be the best solution.
<A[Distance|Removal]> of the <M[animal flour]> from the fodders, and indeed not only for cattle and sheep, but also for pigs, poultry and fish,
That is not <U[hinnehmbar]>.
Such regulations would be suitable, to restore the confidence the consumer and to receive to the farmers the <M[solidarity <A[message|embassy]>]> let, that we want to send them.
It is urgently necessary to go still further - and to put a change of the Common <A[Agrarian Policy|Agricultural Policy]> into the eye.
The <A[prohibition|ban]> of the use of <M[animal flour]> as <M[animal <A[feeds|fodders|linings]>]> is only the first step on this way.
We regret on the other hand very much that the amendments been worth by our <A[faction|fraction]> did not find any approval.
My opinion's it would be logical, to lower the working time of the employees in the <A[companies|operations]> harmful to the environment.
<A[Make|Let]> me underline once again definitively that the general circulation of the utilization of dangerous waste must not bring us in order to compensate us with the production of such a waste.
If for example indeed the pensions were not so low that they do not suffice for the living, there would be less arms.
The report plans <A[means|resources|funds]> at the level of 100 million euros for a period of five years for the decrease of the poverty.
The <A[proposal|suggestion]> to initiate a second <M[Luxembourg <A[process|trial]>]> in the <A[field|area]> of the social exclusion of the guidelines and national plans includes, my unlimited support finds.
The report requires the <A[installation|list|preparation]> of qualitative and quantitative indicators for the social exclusion.
The commission of the request of the <A[council|advice]> keeps up with the pattern of <A[their|her]> <A[proposal|suggestion]> for a program to the abatement of social exclusion, "to June 2000" one "Initiative for the cooperation on this field" to create.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, I abstained for a very <A[concrete|actual]> reason: With this report the <A[progress|headway]> for which I had hoped and wanted is not achieved after my estimation in ecological respect.
I hope for this system liking to find circulation in all cities of Europe.
Some <A[Proposals|Suggestions]> of the European Parliament are unrealistic and do not find my approval.
Also must succeed in future better in making existing <U[Bestpractice]> public in a best known way.
Ecology-minded big-income earners receive the possibility to contribute to a cleaner energy voluntarily in a liberalized market while for the others everything is remaining with the old man.
<A[According to|After]> the agenda the common pronunciation follows <A[about|over]> following <M[resolution <A[requests|applications]>]>:
It is a question in this case of following three reasons: Firstly this <A[request|application]> corresponds to the <A[process|trial]> of the consolidation of the democracy and the increasing demand for <A[respect|attention|caution]> of the human rights, in particular with respect to the <U[indigenen]> <M[population groups]>.
In this debate we would like to bring the solidarity and support of our institution opposite the Central-American Parliament to the expression as my <U[Vorredner]> said aptly. This happens at a time since we support the <M[exterior relationships]> of the European Union to the countries <U[Iberoamerikas]> keeping on enjoying priority.
I do not have the reservations concerning the human rights, that our colleague and esteemed friend, Mr <U[Seguro]>, president of the delegation responsibly for the relationships with Central American countries and Mexico, authorized was to be expressed.
Finally the commission refers also in the dialog with the central-American authorities repeatedly to the <A[importance|meaning]> which one must attach to the regional <M[integration <A[process|trial]>]> as an instrument for the consolidation of the democratization and the <A[development|evolution]> in this field.
In order to cling to the power, he did not hesitate, the senseless debate over this "<U[Ivoritaet]>" to take possession, that activated a wave of the xenophobia: Hate on the others the foreigner, the <U[Burkinabé]> or the <U[Malinesen]>, of which many live very much since many years on Ivorian <A[ground|bottom]> and work.
Assumption for the production of a <A[real|genuine]> democracy in <U[Côte]> d '<U[Ivoire]> are the use of an independent <M[investigation commission]> <A[about|over]> the committed crimes and the official <A[obligation|commitment]> for the <A[compliance|keeping]> of the human rights and the <A[internal|inner]> peace.
Some that is democracy from relative <A[importance|meaning]> mean if it is a question of Africa, these are complex procedures and one is supposed to <A[make|let]> the time for <A[himself|herself]> be worked. On the other hand I think, that there can not be any compromise with regard to the democracy and that d '<U[Ivoire]> today the same question puts as for example in Guinea, where one knows that people are arrested and there is not any democratic system.
<A[Make|Let]> me say one thing definitively still: Dictatorships are only possible because there are nations which live in the misery which do not have any <A[access|entrance]> to knowledge and findings.
It would not be illogical if the European Union which this time all <A[candidates|nominees]> <A[could|might]> participate in demanded today new <M[premiership <A[choices|elections]>]>.
In many parts of Africa we have to do it with very different ethnic and religious mixtures.
At these <A[choices|elections]> the national representation of the political parties that was excluded from the <M[president choice]> must be made possible all the more, when also only partial, to balance the <A[inadequacies|deficiencies|shortcomings]> of this first choice.
for the situation in Burma
A large-scale offensive is led against the <U[Shan]> and the cirques and as the <M[<U[UN]> reporter]> exported there are not any signs for a dialog between <U[SDPC]> and <U[NLD]>.
Therefore we confirm once again the <A[importance|meaning]> of this resolution and the fixed <A[obligation|commitment]> of the commission and the <A[council|advice]> in this direction.
I hope, that the European parliament gives a clear signal to the Burmese nation through the <A[treatment|handling|processing]> of this question in the <M[priority debate]>, that <A[his|its]> desperate situation is not forgotten, that we recognize, that the situation becomes rather more bad than better in Burma, and that we are decided, to do something against that.
That long lasted.
<A[Just|Precisely]> in Asia the danger that economical and political reforms are uncoupled exists that there can be economical <A[progress|headway]> and economical liberalization without liberalization in the political <A[field|area]> and without strengthening of the constitutional state although I think that without functioning constitutional state in the long run also <A[trade|commerce]>, subsidies and investments are lost.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! I can agree to my <U[Vorrednern]> in many essential points, because many things of what today happens in Vietnam are not acceptable.
Meanwhile the <M[human rights organization]> <U[Human Rights Watch]> which mentioned also Mr <U[Swoboda]> declares that Vietnam undertook some <A[just|precisely]> in the question of the human rights in last time in order to improve the situation.
These <A[severely|austerely]> secret documents give us a rare look behind the <A[sceneries|backdrops|wings]> of the <A[politics|policy]> of the Vietnamese government.
The commission is kept on being convinced, however, from that of a <A[durable|permanent]> solution of the current situation being able to be reached only <A[about|over]> a dialog between the <M[military regime]>, the democratically elected opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities.
Also an <A[unequivocal|unambiguous]> pressure exists on the part of the Vietnamese authorities towards a <A[selfcensorship|selfmark]> of the own press.
<A[According to|After]> the agenda the pronunciation follows <A[about|over]> following <M[resolution <A[requests|applications]>]>:
We need also the <A[help|assistance]> and support of the <U[EU]>, not only in the southwest of England, but in all affected fields.
I ask you all for supporting our resolution.
It is urgently offered that the European Union does not restrict itself to extraordinary remedial measures to the entry of disasters.
The commission took two initiatives in this <A[connection|context]>.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! An <A[error|mistake]> linguistic in that occurred during the insertion of one of the amendments into the common resolution.
To postpone the vote means to change the task onto the commission.
(The parliament accepts the <M[resolution <A[request|application]>]>. )
The report takes the <A[determination|statement]> as a basis, that an increasing part of the attendance of patients in Europe is covered by <M[addition health insurances]>.
I think it a little strange that one wants to tie now already the hands to the commission for a <M[guideline <A[proposal|suggestion]>]>, but demands a <M[green book]> about the present state of the voluntary insurances and <M[sick person addition insurances]> from the commission simultaneously.
Faced with the fact that the part of older people increases at the population strongly it is important to understand the improvement of the health service for the people in whole Europe into the eye.
We can not take in that part of course.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! Many things speak for a procedure sped up during the <A[conversion|transfer]> of the results of the <M[<U[Basler]> new <A[composure|setting|version]>]> of the <M[<U[Kapitaladäquanz]> <A[regulation|arrangement]> frame]>.
What affects the feeling of the priority that Ms <U[Villiers]> still put on the feeling of the necessity provided by the commission when <A[it|she]> demands the <A[assumption|acceptance]> of the measures in a procedure sped up it is to be said so that that one admits reporter itself that this <A[regulation|arrangement]> will not have any influence on the competition-adverse practices that are more <U[leider]> in the United States spread.
We must also pay attention of course to Basel not resulting <A[besides|in addition]> in another second disadvantage arising to the <A[banks|benches]> through higher <M[privately owned capital <A[requirements|requests]>]>.
After these preliminary notes I would like to refer to the <M[business section <A[takers|buyers|recipients]>]> considering in my opinion also the approach which underlies these <A[regulations|arrangements]> for the capital which support the topics in the <A[connection|context]> with the risk as satisfactory.
These are some first thoughts over how we <A[could|might]> achieve within the present <A[regulations|arrangements]> of the contract a <A[speedy|uninterrupted]> <M[legislation <A[process|trial]>]> which would be controllable and efficient.
So the moment came now to <A[acknowledge|recognize]>, that the institution is of the "European Citizen agent" grown-up enough and has given already sufficient proofs of that, that she has the <A[maturity|ripeness]> now for an own budget.
The <U[PPE-DE-Fraktion]> ever supports the opinion of the committee for constitutional questions that the competences of the <M[civil representative]> should be broadened faster, all the better, in particular with regard to the <M[investigation <A[authorities|authorizations]>]> of the <M[civil representative]> defined by 1994 in article 3 of the decision.
A <M[civil representative]> succumbs of course to <M[secrecy rules]>, but it is to be known important for the citizens and citizens, that <A[it|he]> or <A[it|she]> than <M[civil representative]> <A[access|entrance]> to acts that keep on being denied to the remaining citizens can receive.
The recommendation <A[directed|done]> onto the commission by the ombudsman was starting point of the present report afterwards at facilitating the <A[access|entrance]> of the <A[applicants|candidates]> and <A[applicants|candidates]> to <A[their|her]> own corrected <M[<A[examination|test]> <A[works|jobs]>]> <A[with|in the case of]> the selection methods organized by her.
We mean, that the <M[<A[attitude|setting]> procedures]> of the <A[facilities|institutions]> of the community, and in fact all <M[<A[attitude|setting]> procedures]>, in order to exclude every suspicion from partiality, iniquity or incompetence of the administration, with maximum <A[frankness|openness]> and transparency <A[in front of|before]> themselves should go.
In this case I refer for example to an amendment concerning the demand for the indisputable proof of a verbal <A[examination|test]>.
Colleague <U[Bösch]> paid attention already shortly to the amendments for the report here.
After my having <A[directed|done]> two inquiries to the realization and organization of the last internal announcement onto the commission, I got precise and detailed <A[answers|replies]> to that.
So <M[administration <A[processes|trials]>]> are arranged openly and transparently.
Firstly, <A[with|in the case of]> the <A[examinations|tests]> carried out by the commission the corrections occur always anonymously.
July 2000 was meant <A[unequivocally|unambiguously]>.
Votes
(The parliament refuses the <A[request|application]> for prorogation of the vote. )
<A[With|In the case of]> the evaluation of the guideline <A[about|over]> the own resources of <A[credit institutions|credit institutes]> several interests <A[standing|being]> in conflict to each other must be weighed carefully.
So the idea of a European <M[police academy]> arose for the member states of the European Union and for the <M[<A[candidate|nominee]> countries]>.
Also the reporter represents this point of view, and the European People's Party also divides <A[it|him]>.
The social situation in most member states of the European Union requires now in fact absolutely cross-border cooperation between the different police services.
Apparently most of my <U[Vorredner]> hold it for indispensable that the academy has a single <A[durable|permanent]> seat.
The <A[provisional|temporal|temporary]> <U[soundsovielte]> one, however not revocable decision, with which the <A[council|advice]> for usual makes a small present for our parliament.
The reporter would like also <M[criminality prevention]>, provision of services, innovation and supervision of the <A[borders|boundaries]> included know and to see the protection of the <A[internal|inner]> <A[security|safety]> changed in the sense of the maintaining of the public order.
Those ones were the ideals which suggested it to us, and the state for which they worked looked like this.
I would welcome a leveling of standards in some member states of the European Union.
Since the first considerations in this matter, that were started on initiative of the European Parliament on European level, the commission committed itself opposite the member states to bringing an action with the <A[objective|destination|purpose]> onto the way to establish something what we <A[could|might]> regard as European <M[police culture]> that is based on the highest state of the <M[professional ethic]>, the <A[respect|attention|caution]> of the rights and freedoms of the citizens and the effectiveness of the fight against the criminality.
This plans a <A[development|evolution]> of the <M[police academy]> in the first place on <M[government level]>.
For the mentioned reasons the <M[Europe representatives]> of the Communist Party of Greece vote against the report.
- (<U[SV]>) I voted against the preliminary <A[equipment|institution]> of the European <M[Police Academy]>.
No doubt that many of our <A[courts|dishes]> very slowly and deliberately work exists, and it is very difficult to <A[convince|touch]> her of a fast action in these questions.
As a matter of course the suggested <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]> is not complete since <A[it|she]> is based on the <M[Brussels <U[II]> <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]>]> that not for children of separated living as well as single parents is valid.
My mother took in such a divorce and kidnapping 85 years ago part, and <A[it|she]> still speaks of that today.
Therefore I would like to say to the parliament that the commission suggests in the scheme about the <A[mutual|reciprocal]> recognition of civil law decisions - that is decided on it is to be hoped <A[until|by]> end of the year - the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> of the area of application of the <M[Brussels <U[II]> <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]>]> and to attribute <A[uppermost|supreme]> and highest priority also to this <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]> of the <M[visit right]> in this way so that they are valid just the same for children of pairs gotten married without difference as for children from life partnerships.
We come now to the vote.
Meanwhile the sport - that must be said - is combined with other branches of trade closely, for example with enterprises of the audiovisual sector or the <M[advertising-branch]> and the <M[sport article sale]>.
What we need is a clever, flexible interpretation of the present <A[regulations|arrangements]>.
Strictly speaking it is a question of an attack on the democracy, to defend so very much we to us also, to see the things from this <A[vantage point|observatory]>.
The commission expects therefore an <A[answer|reply]> to <A[their|her]> call shortly around <A[detailed|full]> information about the measures planned by the British government.
The <A[proposal|suggestion]> was presented by the Minister of Finance in the <A[connection|context]> with a <M[budget preliminary design]> half a year <A[in front of|before]> the <A[declaration|explanation]> to the general budget in the spring 2001.
Also I think what Mr <U[Simpson]> said helped in exceptional manner to confirm us in the regard onto the probable <A[intentions|purposes]> of the government of the United Kingdom.
Through jams we do not lose only a lot of time, costs not only high arise, but that is a very great problem <A[just|precisely]> for the environment, and therefore I believe if in fact the British government uses the money for solving the problems then all something of that, in particular all citizens of Europe, have.
We are the only <M[oil producers]> more or less in the European Union and nevertheless have the highest gasoline and diesel prices of all countries of Europe - we pay 1,20 pounds in the United Kingdom for a liter of diesel.
In this way this <M[agenda point]> is finished.
It is The European Parliament guiltily to assure them that it <A[stands|is]> at <A[their|her]> <A[page|side]>. I ask you in turn for rising to a <M[keeping quiet minute]> in order to bring our solidarity and our dismay to the expression.
Woman president, I would like to support this <A[proposal|suggestion]> fully and very since I belong to those that proposed to incorporate this point.
We are a good piece gotten on.
The <U[EU]> will build up <A[their|her]> relationships to the most important groups and get with the new government into contact in addition as quickly as possibly in the USA.
Faced with the ­ which surprise ­ of enthusiastic report by Mr <U[Prescott]> <A[about|over]> that one deal, <A[which|who]> he himself did not negotiate, I can not get on, why <A[it|he]> not only of Ms <U[Voynet]>, but, as I mean, and this is my last question onto the commissioner, also of almost all other European <M[environmental ministers]> was refused.
Now the danger that we must have lost the swing, the American <M[negotiation partners]> change <A[their|her]> point of view, and we must completely begin in the May from front exists.
The forests were the big <M[quarrel point]> this time.
That a <A[constant|steady]> <A[warming|heating]> of the earth would flood parts of <A[their|her]> territory for some <M[EU countries]> for the consequence or are quilted.
You have a high <M[prosperity level]> and low prices for oil products.
I congratulate Ms <U[Wallstroem]> for <A[their|her]> efforts in The Hague and <A[wish|want]> her more success.
<A[Beyond doubt|Certainly]> it was better, for no <A[agreement|arrangement]> to come as too a bad, because the American <A[proposal|suggestion]> was completely inadequate and for Europe under no circumstances acceptable.
<M[Climate changes]> have comprehensive consequences in the developing countries.
I would like to repeat it in English: <U[Forest turns from being carbon sinks to carbon sources]>.
Only if the European Union remains credible, can <A[they|she|it]> <A[with|in the case of]> the discussions and the actual measures on that one COP6- "at" in Bonn the initiative take over.
We must carry out our own <A[assessment|estimation]> of the events and prepare documents, around with the different parties and <A[natural|unaffected]> this "<U[Umbrella]> group" to get into contact.
Of course the step in the connection to the next COP6 or the continuation of the COP6 consists in the <A[agreement|convention]> being also ratified then in the union.
Before the European <A[Council|Advice]> we, that is <U[Pierre Moscovici]> and I, will hold another <M[written examination <A[meeting|session]>]> on the coming Sunday on <M[minister level]> which I invited Mr <U[Brok]> and Mr <U[Tsatsos]> to and on the Monday, on the occasion of the meeting of the advice "<U[Allgemeine]> matters" becomes still to occur a <A[meeting|session]> of the <M[government conference]>.
The lowest number of <M[participant states]> might be defined on eight while the possibility to demand a <A[unanimous|monophonic]> decision of the <A[council|advice]> which at the present time de facto represents a <A[right of veto|veto power]> is being supposed to be replaced by a right of appeal.
One can regret that, however, I must <A[hold|keep]> this fact.
The European <A[Council|Advice]> deals also with the state of the <M[<A[entry|joining]> negotiations]> and accordingly with the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]>.
The European <A[Council|Advice]> of Lisbon had accepted guidelines for the promotion of an innovative and competitive Europe.
The consumer protection represents an increasingly more <A[significant|important]> request of the Europeans for obvious reasons which I do not keep on having to come in attention to.
We must prepare ourselves for this unprecedented <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]>.
This is in fact the criterion by means of which we must evaluate the peak of Nice in the end.
(Applause)
Firstly the <M[<A[entry|joining]> <A[candidates|nominees]>]> must take over and turn over the shared <M[<A[possession|property]> state]>. This is also our task.
A lot suits to us at the <M[basic right charter]>, and we do not want it to be propagated only splendidly.
The text <A[could|might]> be, however, better <A[formulated|worded]>; it can be improved, however, also to Nice and specified.
I think it simply impossible that several governments simply swept the question of the <A[photo|reception]> of a reference to the charter into the article 6 of the contract from the table.
You do not want to incorporate <A[it|her]> even into the contracts, which is a proof of this text, this <U[Elaborat]>, being supposed to be put aside.
In the WTO are supposed to occur we with a common joyless <A[voice|vote]>.
I think, that in the face of the nevertheless rather gloomy chances of success the load of the <M[government conference]> with a further complex and controversial topic no intelligent move would be.
I appeal emphatically to the French chairmanship, to undertake maximum efforts, in this way this <A[fissure|abyss|gap]> is closed, because <A[it|she]> seems most extremely destructive.
For the trade policy the commission elaborated a <A[proposal|suggestion]> which must be considered carefully.
Although with the previous contract certain <A[progress|headway]> could be achieved concerning the expansion of the formula, also the mad formula of the <U[Mitentscheidung]> was called in this way into the life including the unanimity <A[with|in the case of]> questions of the <A[nationality|citizenship]>, the social <A[security|safety]>, the <A[photo|reception]> and practice of <A[independent|standalone]> employments and the <M[culture <A[politics|policy]>]>.
The fact that this question surrenders is already a clear proof of the failure of a <A[politics|policy]> for the <A[strengthening|refreshment]> of the <A[links|obligations]> of the <A[mutual|reciprocal]> confidence between the countries of the union at itself.
That is nevertheless the situation in which we are in this <M[government conference]> since months because no one gives up <A[his|its]> toy.
The experiences of this year lead us to the <A[determination|statement]>, that we must not trust in the meanwhile exhausted method of the negotiations exclusively led between the <M[government representatives]> <A[with|in the case of]> the <A[progress|headway]> that must be achieved to Nice with look on the future of Europe in the <U[Konstitutionalisierungsprozess]> of the union.
The qualified majority does not become the rule, then becomes in this way, Mr <U[Prodi]> arrested that a little while ago very correctly, the decision definitively blocked.
This aspect of the subsidiarity was not mentioned in our present pronunciation, is, however, from great <A[importance|meaning]>.
We made it like this, the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> of 1995 occurred, it the <M[<A[reflection|reverberation]> group]> so <A[circumspectly|prudently]> <A[guided|led]> by <U[Carlos Westendorp]> came, it came to Amsterdam, and now we will have Nice and we practically <A[stand|are]> at the same point, Mr <U[Präsident]>: We circle around the institutional topics without finding solutions which give us the possibility for the fulfillment of an extremely pretentious task, the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> on 27.
Do not <A[make|let]> us add also still the great disappointment of the nations <A[about|over]> our parliament to the disappointment which will cause the conference of Nice anyhow if <A[it|she]> ends without result.
In the past we proved that this <A[objective|destination|purpose]> is possible, and as a citizen of a member state which profited by a <A[scheduled|systematic]> crossing for the <A[membership|affiliation]> I expect an expanded and peaceful Europe with great expectations.
However, if one <A[himself|herself]> has a <A[right of veto|veto power]>, it must be clear that this has to be valid also for all others.
However, a first <A[change|alternation]> will be necessary in the parliament to be elected in 2004 because at least some member states will come to that before the choice or during the <M[choice period]> 2004-2009.
The Mr <U[Ratspräsident]> spoke to the question of the increasing cooperation and declared one moves in this matter onto a consensus too.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! At First Sight it is a question in Nice of the <U[left overs]> and of the adaptations necessary faced with the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]>.
We would own also only a spark of that mentality in this respect, than we put onto negative <A[developments|evolutions]> in our part of the world of little <A[stress|accentuation]> and <A[processes|trials]> proceeding positively <A[could|might]> put more strongly into the foreground, then we would be happier than it is the case at the present time.
We should not only the <U[Waren]>-, but to include also the <M[service traffic]>, appropriate to that, the investments, the intellectual property and the competition in the majority decision of the Council of Ministers and to change the article 133 paragraph 1 according to the contract.
An <M[Initiative Right]> of the European Parliament would open, however, <U[Tür]> and <U[Tor]> also in this highly-sensitive question of party-political arbitrariness.
One must be therefore also capable how it said it to one of you when <A[he|it]> paid attention to the American optimism and the kind in which the Americans of themselves speak to emphasize what runs that gets on.
I would also like to say to you that there is not any problem of the large ones and the small countries according to my opinion.
We did a lot, nevertheless we <A[find|bump]> this old problem again and again, and I do only not believe that a <A[development|evolution]> would set in here because a single country moves, because we have to do it here as I would like to repeat with very strong national, political, democratic realities in twelve from fifteen countries.
Mr <U[Präsident Védrine]>, you stated that there is a maybe too tension-loaded climate here, and you spoke also of a certain pessimism.
Furthermore I would like to ask you for undertaking everything in order to intensify the <A[security requirement|safety requirements]> to adequate manner so that such an incident can not be repeated.
I believe that we have to <A[find|hit]> precautions for that that we did not <A[find|hit]> by far yet, that the guests of this parliament can feel in this house as guests and they do not have to be afraid of threat.
Hospitality here, hospitality and <A[respect|attention|caution]> also there.
<A[Many thanks|Thanks a lot]> for your carrying out, Mr <U[Tajani]>.
It is the best honor that we can do to <U[Ernest Lluch]> and to <A[his|its]> life to follow <A[his|its]> <A[message|embassy]> - in Catalan she calls <U[dìaleg]>. Can we all give a chance to the dialog in the Basque Country?
On the other hand everyone can express of course <A[his|its]> opinion.
(B5-0549 / 2000) of gentlemen <U[Brok]> in the name of the committee for foreign affairs, human rights, common <A[security|safety]> and <M[defense <A[politics|policy]>]> onto the <A[council|advice]> for the political situation and humanitarian <A[help|assistance]> in Afghanistan;
If I speak of organization, I also think then that the European Union which undertakes such great efforts also for that should get the responsibility.
Secondly you will find the very <A[unequivocal|unambiguous]> will of the parliament in the resolution, to base the <A[security|safety]> and defense <A[politics|policy]> on two harmonious <A[pillars|piers]>: the civilian <M[crisis overcoming]> and in the case of a failure onto the military <M[crisis overcoming]> <A[with|in the case of]> which these two <A[pillars|piers]> complement themselves <A[mutually|reciprocally]>.
Gentleman I will attempt <U[Präsident]>, faced with the delay already kicked in and the <A[obligations|commitments]> that I have today still to shorten the contribution that I had prepared a little.
These relationships become in particular <A[about|over]> meetings between the <U[NATO-Rat]> and the <U[COPSI]> as well as meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European <M[<A[applicant|candidate]> countries]> and / or the ally made.
When example is referred to the events on the Balkans from which one can say that everyone perceived <A[his|its]> role fully.
In this period we kept the USA on the <A[developments|evolutions]> up-to-date also comprehensively in the frame of the European <A[security|safety]> and defense <A[politics|policy]>, what an indispensable condition for <A[her|its]> developing <A[harmoniously|harmonically]> as this is the case in the moment is.
So the second annual report of the European Union was presented to the European Parliament <A[about|over]> the human rights, and a <M[human rights forum]> will occur on the 13th December in Paris.
This <A[politics|policy]>, so you find, does not strive for becoming the competitor of the Atlantic alliance that today the <A[basis|element]> is to the collective defense of <A[their|her]> members, or setting up a <A[constant|permanent]> European army.
If I have <A[mentioned|named]> the number of 100 000 man, this does not mean then that we want to outdo the <A[objective|destination|purpose]> defined in Helsinki but that we have a reserve from different qualifications and specializations so that safeguarded is that to be able to be reached the corresponding to the <A[objective|destination|purpose]> of the <A[council|advice]> 60 000 man among all conditions of use.
<A[Make|Let]> me now in very short words pay attention to the actual political sense of this new task accepted from a majority of our public with which Europe attains an up to now missing instrument of the political influence.
However, we <A[stand|are]> now also before the problem to have to guarantee for our meaning the <A[entire|whole]> continent if it is talked about the <U[Festigung]> of the liberal democracy in Europe, because for that it <A[works|goes]> <A[with|in the case of]> the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> and the <M[<A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> <A[process|trial]>]>.
We must combine three <A[fields|areas]> for a coherent whole, the <M[community politics]>, the <U[GASP]> including the <U[ESVP]> and national measures of the member states.
In spite of the extensive procedures within the commission we no 60 000 soldiers need strong troop in order to realize our <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]>.
A possibility of the grant of humanitarian <A[help|assistance]> must be found therefore urgently.
I do not agree indeed to the cynics who say Europe gets in this way a toy which is not usable to anything. However, it applies that the <M[quickness rapid deployment force]> will not be immediately usable in numerous situations.
The <U[EU]> should not form any own defense with <A[firm|fixed|steady]> troops.
I would like to bring the concern of my <A[faction|fraction]> to the end <A[about|over]> the <U[verschlimmernde]> situation in Afghanistan to the expression and ask the commission as well as the <A[council|advice]> to that as far as its being possible to them to intensify <A[their|her]> efforts for a peaceful solution and an assistance for the <M[<A[civil|civilian]> population]> especially now before the <M[winter burglary]>.
In order to express it with very <A[simple|easy]> words: Where, when and how should the European rapid deployment force in future be employed?
The interview explains as the frightening balance of these two months of <U[Intifada]> was achieved that patrols itself onto 270 dead, mostly Palestinians, and wounded almost 10 000 often for life hindered.
Therefore <A[it|he]> is also incessantly called in for creating oneself an arsenal to most terrible kind at weapons of mass destruction.
To the other one and in the contrast to what my <U[Vorrednerin]> said I do not know whether it would be possible or desirable that the European Union does faced with the conflict and the escalation of the <A[power|violence]> in the Near East more than up to now particularly now, during the transitional period in which the USA are.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, in my <M[speech contribution]> I would like to pay attention to the report by Ms <U[Lalumière]>, that my opinion's very good and <A[unequivocally|unambiguously]> <A[formulated|worded]> is.
But there is not any political <A[draft|plan]>, and no common exterior and <A[security|safety]> <A[politics|policy]> really still exists.
The <U[EU]> has only a problem, indeed that she did not gain the <M[public interest]> in such actions up to now although these considerably more lastingly and considerably are more effective.
A further point affects as a matter of course the question of the distribution of the <M[budget <A[means|resources|funds]>]>.
I express this in spite of the great number of manifest insurances on this topic that were to be <U[vernehmen]> in the last days as by chance again and again.
Our potential is currently still very restricted. The member states should reconsider <A[their|her]> defense expenditures that distinguish from country to country considerably <A[final|finite]>.
Even those ones <A[who|which]> question the benefit of the decision for example for the creation of the so called <M[euro army]> must acknowledge the <A[significant|important]> political content of this decision and <A[his|its]> influence on the cohesion of the European Union.
The first appearance of a <M[defense minister]> in our parliament is so historical that we reserved the <M[night <A[meeting|session]>]> for <A[it|him]> so that the impression is not too strong for our representatives.
For all these conflicts a civilian <M[crisis prevention]> is better than a military action is.
Does Russia, long-term, want to be political <M[union partner]> of an undemocratic regime?
Europe will not represent therefore any new military alliance, as this unites pointed out - how I believe - presumably due to incomplete information.
I received a <M[resolution <A[request|application]>]> to the end of the pronunciation according to article 42 paragraph 5 of the rules of procedure.
Faced with the <A[extent|circumference|volume]> of the task four committees were affected, for which a novel procedure with the <A[creation|production]> was used by four simultaneous reports.
The measures suggested in the <M[white book]> must be used in <A[their|her]> entirety for that, the <A[entire|whole]> mode of operation to modernize to the commission and to <A[shape|tool]> more efficiently.
It would be therefore made to take the reform as the <A[reason|occasion]> in order to restrict <A[their|her]> intervention on the <A[fields|areas]> which do not contain any <A[editions|costs]>.
The occurred <M[evaluation differences]> are not only political nature, but a reflection particularly of the cultural differences between the Fifteen.
The main task of the new internal <M[audit service]>, that you, Mr <U[Kinnock]> when subordinates to the vice-president, responsible for the reform, directly the analysis of the internal control function and system is within the commission.
The cooperation did great fun, and I think, the <A[process|trial]>, to subject the commission of an important reform that is so decisive to the European Union for the future, at depth and <A[fortune|wealth]>, we won there four at that have participated.
You should count, to be moved into other European <A[facilities|institutions]> and/or to be assigned onto the <A[single|individual]> state governments or to work, however, in the private sector.
Therefore our committee refers again to which <A[importance|meaning]> he attaches to a strong, independent, efficient, transparent and politically responsible commission.
As a <M[budget committee]> we think that the <A[installation|list|preparation]> of the budget prepares problems for us after activities due to the small visibility of the <A[editions|costs]> and because of our wish for the <A[strengthening|refreshment]> of the <A[authorities|authorizations]> of the European Parliament as a <M[budget authority]>.
That is supposed to clarify the fixed will of the parliament, to put through this reform together with the commission.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, first of all I would like to thank all four reporters for the achieved <A[work|job]>.
That is embarrassing faced with the fact that the <U[EU]> is even a pioneer of the modernization of the economic life.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, in spite of the efforts of the reporters around support of the activity of the commission it remains a fact that onto the recommendations of the committee of independent experts yet no comprehensive and <A[consistent|logical]> <A[answer|reply]> is given to the commission in the sense of the <A[aspiration|tendency]> <A[to|after]> a real <M[government <A[politics|policy]>]> and not only to a better administration.
The changed attitude is supposed to find <A[their|her]> expression in a transparent <M[administration practice]>.
After my estimation there is not any structure with a greater and more substantial <A[importance|meaning]> on the whole world than the 15, tomorrow already 20 or more countries - a whole continent. That at the strongest industrialized part of the globe of the earth pulsated in the union and through them in the commission above <A[their|her]> structures.
Changes are never <A[simple|easy]>.
In this case the socialist <A[faction|fraction]> thought, however, that the administration of the community functions currently quite effectively.
One knows the result, and therefore have themselves the numerous members the commission and <A[their|her]> administration understanding and occupied with this problem competently.
Thousands of <M[project <A[requests|applications]>]> wait already for an evaluation over a year.
As we could find, it is not a question in the debate of principles, <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]> or chances of the reform so very much, but rather around procedure, speed, schedule, possible troubles or unwanted consequences during <A[their|her]> <A[conversion|transfer]>.
First of all I would like to inform the High House that as Mr <U[van Hulten]> already noticed on the present <A[meeting|session]> of the college a <A[proposal|suggestion]> was accepted for an interinstitutional <A[agreement|arrangement]> in <A[their|her]> frames a discussing <A[array|cluster]> "control for the behavior in the public one service" arrange is designated as in measure 1 of the scheme for the <M[white book]>.
Mr <U[van Hulten]> picked up this point in the <A[race|course|running]> of this debate of my knowledge again.
A simplification, the rise of the transparency, the <A[strengthening|refreshment]> of the <M[budget basic principles]>, is main aim of the <M[new <A[composure|setting|version]>]> then that is actually little exception <A[regulations|arrangements]>, little unintelligible special provisions, and it is called rise of the efficiency and effectiveness in the <M[budget procedure]>.
It is <U[schlichtweg]> also very much uneconomical for the commission, if contracts expire so that for costs <U[X]> 20 % are replaced, for costs <U[Y]> 30 % are replaced and the <A[proofs|receipts]> are then often collected by <U[Kleinstbeträgen]> and are checked.
<A[According to|After]> the agenda the pronunciation follows <A[about|over]> the report (A5-0337 / 2000) of Ms <U[Sauquillo Pérez del Arco]> in the name of the committee for <A[development|evolution]> and cooperation <A[about|over]> the relationships of the European Union to the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the commission on these relationships (2000 / 2051 (<U[INI]>)).
Latter aspects completely affect especially the <U[NRO]>.
This is not <A[natural|unaffected]> sufficing, nevertheless that might protect us in any case against exaggerated representations of the weakness of our <A[development aid|foreign aid]>.
We come to that still too <U[derück]>, because at itself this is a <A[reasonable|sensible]> frame.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, I am not today too <U[derückgekehrt]> there yet from Mozambique, where the European Union gave outstanding humanitarian <A[help|assistance]> after the flood disaster, however, delays it, <M[reconstruction projects]> for which we set already the money readily are again once, all signatures in Brussels beisammen are.
Faced with this reality a greater engagement and a higher efficiency are unavoidable in the abatement of the poverty and under-development.
We have now a harmonized system for the <A[creation|production]> from <M[country strategy papers]> and <M[directing-programs]> for the cooperation in all developing countries.
Furthermore the <A[equipment|institution]> of <U[SEM]> did not offer any solution for the disproportion of eight <M[administration bodies]> blown up keeping on existing.
Woman president, my ladies and gentlemen representatives, woman commissioner! I put very special value on being today <A[with|in the case of]> this pronunciation <A[about|over]> the first <A[parcel|bundle]> for the sea traffic because you will deal with three <A[significant|important]> texts that represent a first vital step in this <A[field|area]> to move unfortunately through the recent events so very much into the focal point of the public in the European parliament in this case.
That would offer from <A[view|sight]> of the <M[<A[council|advice]> chairmanship]> the possibility to discuss with the member states in order to achieve an agreement on the <A[council|advice]> on the basis of your <A[proposals|suggestions]> and the text in first reading, to accept where appropriate with qualified majority.
This rapid and <A[precise|goal-directed]> procedure whose result two <M[erica-<A[parcels|bundles]>]> and six <A[proposals|suggestions]> are activated an enormous dynamics.
The <A[lesson|teaching]> that must pull this parliament this morning, it should lead to the discovery that the <M[lake right]> is in the whole world in a shameful state and it is at the time that we tidy it up.
Onto ships that do not correspond to the <A[norms|standards]> a clear signal must go, that we do not tolerate <A[it|her]> in European waters or in European <A[harbors|ports]>.
At the tankers of low tonnage we accepted a compromise between the 5 000 tons of load-carrying capacity, the limit value of the <U[IMO]>, and the 600 tons of load-carrying capacity, the upper limit suggested by the commission.
These <A[information|specifications]> must be set to the European, state ones and to <M[<A[harbor|port]> authorities]> as well as to the interested public for the <A[decree|disposal]>.
The <A[border|boundary]>-comprehensive nature of the marine environment, that indeed the <A[pollution|soiling]> of a field onto a bigger <A[region|area]> can <A[expand|spread]>, demanded to a community-wide framework for the cooperation in the <A[field|area]> of accident-conditional marine pollution.
Also <M[nature conservation <A[associations|dressings]>]> are included in the cooperation on local level.
The change of the guideline in the sense of a more <A[severe|austere]> <A[application|use]>, a harmonization of the <M[right rules]>, particularly with regard to the selection of the ships to be checked and the field of application of the different <M[inspection forms]>, is to be evaluated of course positively.
I would like to refer once again, that the priority, that to send you a reminder now, not given is.
I think that certainly still <A[with|in the case of]> the <M[<A[liability|adhesion]> <A[border|boundary]>]> for the <M[classification societies]> between <U[Rat]> and parliament people must think once again independently of what is concluded today.
We are a tachograph, a black list, with all these things fully and very understood. Nevertheless I would like you onto a few points attentive do.
Faced with this catastrophic and anarchic situation in the sea traffic Europe of the challenge surrendered, and eleven months <A[according to|after]> the average of the erica the European Union will not be to show a procedure that was worked off so rapidly in the situation as any each before.
At that <A[makes|lets]> appreciate, in which measure the liberal logic <A[stands|is]> in the <A[contradiction|discrepancy]> for a high <M[<A[security|safety]> level]> in the sea traffic.
Which technical measures are ever taken, one of the <M[main <A[sources|springs]>]> for the insecurity will keep on existing as long as one did not stop the exponential growth of the traffic in the zone English Channel and North Atlantic due to the hypertrophy of the North Sea ports.
It would suit the current <M[<A[council|advice]> president]> well to face if <A[it|he]> created order also in <A[his|its]> country.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! Since the <U[Auseinanderbrechen]> of the tanker erica a <A[parcel|bundle]> was tied up under political pressure from measures in order to improve the <A[security|safety]> of ships at sea.
Greek ships simply sank so without there being <A[storm|tempest]> in the <A[area|region]> Mr <U[Gayssot]>.
Thirdly should be then clear if we talk about such dossiers, that between our <M[oil stock]> on the one hand and the fact that we use still fossil combustibles on the other hand no <A[connection|combination]> exists.
We should find <A[at last|finally]> the political courage also to put through our ecological aspirations.
That is, in this <A[field|area]> we <A[bear|carry]> an especially great responsibility and must let every institutional narcissism aside as seems to me.
For Finland it is for the example of essential <A[importance|meaning]> that Russia is included in these <A[agreements|conventions]>.
That affects both the more <A[severe|austere]> <A[requirements|requests]> at the <A[construction|design]> of oil tankers, better rules for the <M[<A[harbor|port]> state control]> than also the intensified <A[regulations|arrangements]> for the <M[classification societies]>, that will be also a result.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! Today we talk about the <M[ship <A[security|safety]>]> at sea by means of three reports which I may congratulate the reporters on.
An urgent need to congratulate the three reporters is it, concerned something the three new <A[proposals|suggestions]> for the <A[security|safety]> at sea, so to me: You produced in very short time the proof of our parliament being firmly decided, new measures for the rise of the maritime <A[security|safety]> to say goodbye for the strengthening of the controls and sharpening of the <M[<A[construction|design]> <A[requirements|requests]>]> and that in the future such disasters can not be accepted anymore.
Woman president! A series of extreme <M[ship disasters]>, particularly with oil tankers, struck in recent past our continent heavily.
More than 80 % of the accidents are onto human failure too <U[derückzuführen]>, however for the human failure there is reasons, that social kind are.
Somebody spoke of "traceability".
With the guideline for the <M[<A[harbor|port]> state control]> should the <A[compliance|keeping]> of international <A[norms|standards]> controls and not to be introduced any new rules.
In amendment 18 the <M[<A[harbor|port]> state control]> is related to the <M[rest times]> of the sailors. The <A[conversion|transfer]> of the regulations <A[about|over]> the working time of sailors is already, however, through the existing guideline 99 / 95 completely covered.
I see with joys that the reporter incorporated a <A[tip|notice]> in amendment 21 on the system for the evaluation of the conditions, and we are agreed on the suggested <M[main <A[punch|push]> direction]>, nevertheless the formulations must be worked on still a little in order to make the whole clearer.
Amendment 4 and that one on point "carat" <A[purchase|reference]> taking part in <A[request|application]> 18 are not acceptable.
I can assure you, that a shipowner that a ship intends near such <M[flag states]> register to <A[make|let]> these <A[his|its]> <A[intention|purpose]>, as soon as our <A[proposal|suggestion]> in force is, should reconsider.
The commissioner spoke for 18 minutes and quoted in this time dozens and <U[Aberdutzende]> from articles and gave back the point of view to the commission.
<A[Proposal|Suggestion]> for a decision of the European Parliament and the <A[council|advice]> <A[about|over]> a <M[measure <A[parcel|bundle]>]> concerning the trans-European net in favour of the collection, <A[creation|production]> and circulation of the statistics of the <A[internal|inner]>- and <U[aussergemeinschaftlichen]> merchandise's (<U[Edicom]>) (<U[KOM]> (00) 0458 - C5-0401 / 00 - 2000 / 0201 (<U[COD]>)) (Committee for economy and currency)
When I therefore the <M[resolution <A[request|application]>]> too <U[derückziehe]>, I would like to bring, however, the conviction to the expression, that our parliament of <A[his|its]> <A[voice|vote]> better hearing <A[could|might]> have provided if it had made a specific and separate <M[resolution <A[request|application]>]> for the so important and difficult questions of the <M[government conference]> in the regard onto the meeting of the European <A[Council|Advice]> from Nice instead of handling <A[it|her]> in the frame of a resolution only, covering also all other <M[agenda points]> of the summit conference.
(Since more than twelve representatives rose from <A[their|her]> places the verbal change is not considered. ) (The parliament accepts the <M[resolution <A[request|application]>]>.
Report (A5-0337 / 2000) of Ms <U[Sauquillo Pérez del Arco]> in the name of the committee for <A[development|evolution]> and cooperation <A[about|over]> the relationships of the European Union to the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the commission on these relationships (2000 / 2051 (<U[INI]>))
I did that as a sign of the protest because the European Union is able not still to intervene in this <A[field|area]> so wie sie this actually must.
Although neither the <A[proposal|suggestion]> for the change of the valid guideline for the <M[<A[harbor|port]> state control]> nor the report are raked watt's the actual claims, they contain some aspects pointing into the correct direction. Therefore we, the <M[Europe representatives]> of the Communist Party of Greece, voted for the report.
Therefore it is regrettable that in the <A[proposal|suggestion]> of the commission the idea was not picked up a real European <M[coast supervision authority]> to the model that in the United States exist "<U[coast]> <U[guards]>" arrange.
Indispensable assumption for the <A[security|safety]> of the ships, <A[which|who]> is protection of the life on sea and the environment the abatement of the incontinence of the shipowners, <A[severe|austere]> measures for the control of the state of the ships, the hard penalization of <M[ship societies]> that offend against the safety regulations, the improvement of the working conditions of the sailors, <A[their|her]> <A[precise|goal-directed]> training as well as a composition of the crew in such a way, that <A[it|she]> is able to be raked to the increased <A[requirements|requests]> onto the ships.
The reporter <U[Hatzidakis]> makes the <A[exact|precise]> opposite more <U[Leider]>.
The average this "erica" in December 1999 brought the question of the <A[security|safety]> at sea onto the political agenda of the community, and the commission has these texts, <A[over|above|about]> which we today, almost a year <A[according to|after]> the disastrous average, to have voted, suggested on urges of the European Parliament.
The present <M[compensation grounds]> are equipped in inadequate measure; that became only far too clear during the disaster of the <U[Brär]> at which the <M[<A[fishing|fishery]> industry]> of the <M[Shetland-islands]> was not compensated for <A[their|her]> losses sufficiently.
Woman president, I had mentioned already that I went formerly to the sea.
The <A[proposals|suggestions]> of the reporter which are aimed at a harmonization on European level can be only positive.
The affecting <A[field|area]> is very important since it affects the <M[ship classification societies]>.
This would <A[rather|earlier]> be a great success, because at the eve of the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> we need no <A[inflexible|rigid]> supranational Europe which is hierarchical and citizen-<A[far|distant]>, but a Europe flexible, close to the nations which counts on the <A[respect|attention|caution]> of the national democracies.
The <M[power fight]> in public increasingly more strongly delivered between numerous member states adjusts the look onto possible compromises.
In Nice the most important task in that of guaranteeing that the institutions of the <U[EU]> work efficiently exists.
I personally expect the peak occurring in a week hopefully!
I am not either for an automatic linking of vote to qualified majority and <U[Mitentscheidung]> and believe also here that every decision to enlarge the <U[Mitentscheidungsbefugnis]> from case to case must be found.
With the change of article 133 of the contract of Amsterdam Europe would extend the votes with qualified majority that currently is valid in the <A[council|advice]> for the merchandise trade onto other <A[fields|areas]> as public services, intellectual property, health or <A[education|formation]>.
In this way the parliament robs itself of the right to influence, keeps still and is silent in respect opposite the <U[Parteilichkeiten]>, the national sense of duty and the governments and forgets in this case <A[his|its]> duties opposite the citizens.
In addition I voted against a text which requires the takeover of the charter of the basic rights into the future contract which is accepted in Nice.
It is an <A[error|mistake]> to divide the union into two classes. Therefore I can not approve that a third of the member states strides more quickly.
<A[His|Its]> new role <U[läutete]> the end of the traditional neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria.
In this report there are many things to <A[whom|which]> the British <A[conservatives|Conservatives]> can give <A[their|her]> support. That applies particularly to the <A[emphasis|reprint]> which is put to the union onto the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]>.
The Danish social democrats in the European Parliament support the report about the realization of a common European <A[security|safety]> and defense <A[politics|policy]>.
However also against the nations of the European Union that the new <M[armament <A[editions|costs]>]> which the report refers to must finance in any case and that does not have even the guarantee that these armed forces are used not a day in the name this "maintaining the order" against she herself.
The <A[proposal|suggestion]> that a state that would not like to participate in a task is obliged to achieve a financial contribution is just as serious that is split up under the states participated in this war.
With military <A[means|resources|funds]> of outside there is not any solution, because neither they do not repair the cause of the conflict yet they cause a change with the public opinion.
That military operations are supposed to be financed to the community from a <M[budget line]> and the member states should achieve a financial contribution for such tasks even if they do not want to involve (Paragraphs 49 and 50).
On the other hand it would <A[suit|stand]> the <U[EU]> well to face if <A[it|she]> reversed the priorities of the <M[Peter mountain tasks]> and concentrated on civilian and humanitarian <M[solution models]> more.
I support this report of my colleague <U[Maj-Britt Theorin]>.
However the needs of this group are only used as an excuse, around the demand after this "tax related (<U[n]>) <U[Absetzbarkeit]> of budget services" and this "adaptation the prices' and costs' onto the financial possibilities the private person" bring.
It is really actually fabulous that we should recommend in the 21st century that the member states should guarantee claim to social security and adequate occupational pension scheme for maids still.
For many <A[young people|adolescents]> illicit work tends to become the first contact with the labor market.
At the worst it is if it still affects for this purpose women from <A[far|distant]> countries who accepted this <A[work|job]> forcedly and do not see any other possibility to deny <A[their|her]> living.
The reform of the commission will be judged by <A[their|her]> results, therefore the necessity of regular <M[thing knick-knack reports]> of the commission during the <A[entire|whole]> <M[program duration]> and the <A[importance|meaning]> of the complete balance expected for December 2002.
Before time not far too long it came due to different scandals and <M[management weaknesses]> in the March 1999 for the <A[resignation|withdrawal]> of the European Commission.
Finally I hold it for absolutely necessary to remind of that that we expect at the same time greater consequence and greater transparency of the commission <A[with|in the case of]> <A[their|her]> daily administrative activity, but also a greater <M[responsible existence]> of this reform vital for the future <A[for her part|for their part]> under strict <A[limitation|restriction]> to the responsibilities assigned to her.
The <A[conservatives|Conservatives]> approve also the <A[determination|statement]> in paragraph 7 of the report, that the democratic control is to guarantee and to make the system of the three <A[pillars|piers]> operative.
(The <A[meeting|session]> is closed at 13.15 o'clock. )
We obtained the information - and I want to add now I can not believe it at all -, that the Council- and will be French President of the State tomorrow only 30 minutes here, in order to talk.
Therefore I lock one I <A[detailed|full]> and reasonable comment from.
We should vote in any case, and I personally am for a resolution as Mr <U[Pöttering]>, Mr <U[Lannoye]> and others suggested this.
These texts were worked on until the night, which is valid for the numerical <M[<A[voice|vote]> distribution]> in the <A[council|advice]> and the <M[seat <A[distribution|dispersion]>]> in the parliament in the same way.
Woman president, I would like to plead with <A[emphasis|reprint]> for not deleting this report <U[de Roo]> from the agenda, because he was prepared very good. On the last <M[environmental peak]> during the French <M[<A[council|advice]> premiership]> a Common Point of View is <A[elaborated|acquired]> at the coming Monday and Tuesday to that.
<A[Many thanks|Thanks a lot]>, Mr <U[Parish]>.
In the committee for foreign affairs, human rights, common <A[security|safety]> and <M[defense <A[politics|policy]>]> whose chairperson he is <A[it|he]> smokes also frequently.
The political <A[basis|element]> is clear: Harmonization of the market considering a high health and consumer protection level, and indeed building up on existing <M[right rules]> and new scientific findings.
It is a question of <A[their|her]> living conditions and view of life, in which the health protection gains increasingly greater <A[importance|meaning]>.
This rule can just the same onto all consumed in the leisure time, however drugs not harmless to be used if none else is influenced except for the person consuming these drugs.
<A[Just|Precisely]> yesterday closed in the United States of <A[processes|trials]> against multinational <M[tobacco company groups]> with a <A[condemnation|conviction]> because of poisoning and <A[wrong|false]> <A[information|specifications]> over the harmlessness of the products at the end of.
Concerning the cigarettes that are forbidden in the <U[EU]> for sanitary reasons, but are exported from the European Union we represent the opinion, that the termination of these exports that is only Correct and <A[Consistent|Logical]>.
Instead of drawing the lessons from the defeat of the 9th October of this year in Luxembourg, we stay <A[with|in the case of]> an attitude which is not lasting juridically.
I heard very exactly what the commissioner said hums to gentlemen: "No massive job losses in this sector.
It is the parliament and the <A[council|advice]>, that have to examine this <M[guideline <A[proposal|suggestion]>]> to approve and among other things the <M[right <A[basis|element]>]>, suitable for that.
I do not believe that one may walk a so narrow way along because independently of the contents - that is substantial, as Mr <U[Maaten]> and others showed exists the danger that hands and feet will be bound to this parliament, to the <A[council|advice]> and to the <M[community institutions]> in <A[their|her]> entirety in the legislative <A[work|job]> of the <M[community institutions]> that is so important for the <A[development|evolution]> of the <M[community right]> provided that this parliament and the <A[council|advice]> accept the restrictive interpretation suggested by the <M[<A[faction|fraction]> chairperson]> of the European People's Party and by Ms <U[Palacio Vallelersundi]>.
<A[His|Its]> weakness lies in the emphasis lying on the promotion of the free competition.
Following to the end: Since the <U[Amsterdamer]> contract the European Parliament is authorized, to coordinate questions of the environmental and consumer protection, and will cooperate in this respect with <A[council|advice]> and commission closely as a matter of course.
In Fact that does not have to do actually anything with tobacco, but the decision of the <U[EuGH]> <A[could|might]> have passed just as well <A[about|for instance]> for an <M[advertising-<A[prohibition|ban]>]> for alcohol or for an <M[advertising-<A[prohibition|ban]>]> for chocolate, since also sugar can be health-harmful as is generally known.
I do simply not understand that a majority of this parliament wants to introduce more generous export rules than it is intended by the own governments of the member states - those governments that nevertheless represent also the many branches that are referred to.
It is proven that 80 % of the smokers want to stop, nevertheless the tobacco industry has to offer only few strategies in order to support these people in that.
If we insist on dictating other countries which <M[health standards]> they should set in our <A[extending|expanding]> our <A[reasonable|sensible]> <A[proposals|suggestions]> onto exports for the home market, we question the whole excellent <A[work|job]> so from gentlemen ship's mates.
We approve the realization of this test through a <M[test lab]> accredited in a country after one EU wide recognized homogeneous method.
The effects of tobacco onto the health are now to a large extent acknowledged, and legislator and <A[general public|community]> came somehow to the conclusion, that it is at the time to issue <A[severe|austere]> rules and rules to this product.
The <M[community rules]> will adapt for this reason to the future international <A[regulations|arrangements]> very well and avert thus the risk of the origin from <M[commercial hindrances]>, strengthen the consumer protection simultaneously and guarantee a high <M[health level]>.
Rather people should wait until the <A[entire|whole]> question of the additives is handled in the first report of the commission.
With regard to <M[lab tests]> the amendment is superfluous <A[about|over]> the permission of tests since in another article it is defined that only such <A[goods|products]> which correspond to the regulations of the guideline may be brought into traffic.
Woman president, this report is very <A[unequivocal|unambiguous]>: The period of validity of guidelines to the summer time is current only onto each five years, connecting must be presented <A[they|she|it]> confines the parliament renewed to the <A[prolongation|lengthening]>.
Woman president, dear colleagues and colleagues! The <A[proposal|suggestion]> of a guideline for the <A[regulation|arrangement]> of the summer time that we consider today I hold for a good <A[proposal|suggestion]>.
I mean therefore, nevertheless the member states and also the population accepted that we should not <A[stay|delay]> in this house with this topic far too long the <A[regulation|arrangement]> of the summer time already to a large extent, and <A[it|she]> was acknowledged as a part of our <M[year rhythm]>.
I am, that the questions concerning the time zones and the harmonization of the <M[summer time <A[regulations|arrangements]>]>, as suggested, in the decision-making power of the member states <A[stay|remain]>.
More would speak for that, the summer time at the end of to end September, about six months after <A[their|her]> beginning.
We approve adequate <A[proposals|suggestions]> on the basis of the conclusions of the report to be created in 2007, mentioned as in article 5.
It is explained that interventions in the human <M[<A[germ|bud|sprout]> railways]> can not be accepted.
We become if we agree to this compromise, still a <A[regulation|arrangement]> that guarantees the therapeutic <A[progress|headway]> and that does not let to the protection of the patients only so in Europe as he is, but that improves have, and therefore I plead for this compromise.
These groups must fall also furthermore into the field of application of the guideline.
I am also pleased with our succeeding in it here, however, the <M[<A[germ|bud|sprout]> railways therapy]> to shoot a bolt.
I would like to congratulate the reporter, Mr <U[Liese]>, on <A[his|its]> report and thank him for <A[his|its]> endeavours towards a compromise faced with the contrasts.
These programs affect the <M[cancer abatement]>, the prevention of AIDS, the <M[<A[addiction|obsession]> prevention]> and the <M[health promotion]>. Your <A[breaking off|abort]> would mean the end of the corresponding plans and the <A[work|job]> of the created networks.
It is exceptionally favorable to prepare the <A[ground|bottom]> already in the front end in order to get on as rapidly as possible and to come closer even when a second reading becomes necessary as possibly so far to the point at which a decision can be made.
Furthermore we must consider, that both the prevention and to become promotion as also the supervision increasingly more important, and therefore must them greater <A[importance|meaning]> attributed and to be designated a higher budget for that.
Woman president! On the occasion of the report's <U[Trakatellis]> to the <A[prolongation|lengthening]> of the present European schemes in the <A[field|area]> of the public health I would like to bring my concern to the expression <A[about|over]> the direction in which the European <A[politics|policy]> moves in the <A[field|area]> of the public health.
I found out that also the <A[council|advice]> signaled <A[his|its]> fundamental consent.
In the European Union the paradoxical situation prevails now, that the <U[Binnengrenzen]> indeed for the free traffic of <A[goods|products]>, persons, services and capital were abolished that 15 <A[borders|boundaries]>, however, keep on being retained in the <A[fields|areas]> of police and justice in <M[<A[punishment|penalty]> things]>. Your elimination is complicated by the member states.
Definitively it <A[remains|stays]> to <A[observe|record]> that the initiative represents a <A[real|genuine]> and important <A[progress|headway]> during the creation of a European <M[<A[criminal law|penal law]> <A[room|space]>]>. If <A[it|she]> also covers only sections and is restricted in <A[their|her]> effect, nevertheless <A[she|it]> pays attention to the actual needs of many European citizens, that until <U[dato]> practically helplessly there stood if they became <A[victims|sacrifices]> of a crime outside of the territory of <A[their|her]> <M[residence country]>.
What did we demand for these people?
Simultaneously worry is to be borne for the <A[specialists|experts]> who perceive the direct contacts to the <A[victims|sacrifices]> receiving a specific training.
<A[Victims|Sacrifices]> must not become twice <A[victims|sacrifices]>, <A[first|only]> <A[victim|sacrifice]> of the crime and still the system.
In this <A[connection|context]> it is also important, that the <A[members|relatives]>, the family of the <A[victim|sacrifice]>, discretely and professionally are informed of the <A[facts|states of affairs]> and, if wanted, to be able to reckon also the necessary support, and that they do not have to find out everything from the press.
That is valid independently of the kind of the crime.
We may come off neither on more national even on <M[EU level]> ever of the basic principle, that an individual must always <A[bear|carry]> the responsibility for <A[his|its]> own actions.
In other cases which <A[their|her]> own one is not it <A[could|might]> be necessary to get the <A[needed|required]> information in a language of the union.
I am pleased with the benevolent reaction of the parliament to this first text to one such meaning topic, so that the <A[room|space]> of the freedom, the <A[security|safety]> and the right that we <A[just|precisely]> construct offers our fellow citizens protection in situations that one often manages only with <A[effort|trouble]>.
Vote about the priority
(The parliament refuses the priority. )
So we agreed in the night on the corners of a <M[house <A[hold|stop]>]> which is surely not <A[reasonable|sensible]> brilliantly, but absolutely from the 23rd to the 24th November with the <A[council|advice]>.
The commission had suggested also a revision for that around 300 million euros. The <A[council|advice]> defended itself with hands and feet against that.
But I know also from conversations that it is more difficult around a multiple to <A[formulate|word]> a <U[verhandelbare]> <M[<A[council|advice]> position]>, to get a mandate and to <A[make|let]> the pure national egoisms lead to a quite <A[reasonable|sensible]> and justifiable All-European decision.
I hope, that the <A[works|jobs]> for a common <U[recruitment office]>, as it means on <U[Neudeutsch]>, therefore a European <M[<A[attitude|setting]> authority]>, also really to get on in this way we the problems that come up to all institutions in the next years - on the <A[council|advice]> just the same as on the commission, the parliament and also the other institutions -, the <M[personnel <A[need|requirement]>]> indeed of the coming years, together overcome.
The <A[council|advice]> refuses this revision - now we should have actually already the data - and I would like to warn him as a precaution: The <M[flexibility instrument]> in two years following in each other - actually in less than fifteen months and the first time less than six months <A[according to|after]> <A[assumption|acceptance]> of the Financial Envisaging - to use, the <M[flexibility instrument]> weakens financially, because it <A[his|its]> restoration and possible cumulation that is planned to up to a <A[height|level]> by 600 million prevents.
This considerable sum which is owed to the high <A[need|requirement]> in the year 2001 can be financed in particular through the demands of the <M[flexibility instrument]> at the level of 200 million euros.
Considering these new <A[facts|states of affairs]> the <A[council|advice]> accepted in second reading a budget which shows an increase around 2,5 %.
Before finally you adopt this budget, I would still like to emphasize which value the <A[council|advice]> puts onto the <A[compliance|keeping]> of some basic <M[budget rules]> with regard to the <A[attitude|setting]> from <A[means|resources|funds]> into the reserve, the <M[right <A[basis|element]>]> and the division of the <A[editions|costs]>.
And in the contrast to Nice are, I believe, all three institutions - European Parliament, <A[council|advice]> and commission - with the result under the <A[line|stroke]> quite satisfied.
My ladies and gentlemen! The renewed location of <U[BSE]>-sick cattle made <A[immediate|instant]> action necessary also for the <M[budget <A[field|area]>]>, indeed during the health protection, during the consumer protection, but also during the <A[help|assistance]> for the farmers affected from this situation.
In the remaining one the <A[council|advice]> set for the <A[general-purpose program|skeleton program]> to the support of the reconstruction in the <M[west Balkans]> an <M[increase year amount]> which indeed represents only a standard value, but accords with the Financial Envisaging.
With hanging and choking we knocked out still a few millions of euros more.
My cordial thanks at Ms <U[Haug]>.
Think therefore of this 1 % of the budget of the European Union being very well used.
If I have understood you correctly, you said then that we must not use the reserve because that offends against the rules.
I think therefore we saw very good things next to a lot other one <A[which|who]> I can not mention now because of the shortness of the time.
While the <U[Agrarausgaben]> <A[who|which]> define almost half of the <A[entire|whole]> <M[house <A[hold|stop]>]> are still increasing around more than 5 % considering the <M[adjustment writing]> also in the coming year, the growth of the <A[entire|whole]> <M[house <A[hold|stop]>]> is only 3,5 %.
We see now already the great danger that in the next years the quarrel will increase between <U[MEDA]>, <M[Mediterranean Sea adjoining owner state projects]> and Balkans although we nevertheless all know that money is <A[just|precisely]> needed urgently there.
Satisfied over having overcome the difficulties that piled up to the targeted <A[objective|destination|purpose]> on the way, fulfilling the <A[obligations|commitments]> received in Helsinki opposite the <M[<A[applicant|candidate]> countries]> without exploding the union, and moving the future Europe into the state furthermore efficient act.
However <A[progress|headway]> was achieved, real <A[progress|headway]>, even if these do not go so far as the premiership would have wanted - that proved a great <A[frankness|openness]> seen national as I would like to say.
For the statute of the European parties a new <M[right <A[basis|element]>]> is planned, and the parliament receives the right of the bringing of an action according to article 230 of the contract.
In the last months three <A[significant|important]> steps were done forward.
This is the <A[objective|destination|purpose]> of the <A[declaration|explanation]> accepted in Nice concerning that and the initiated considerations in order to coordinate the abatement of the doping on European level.
The <M[climate <A[warming|heating]>]> appertains to the <M[environmental dangers]> - how on all sides is known.
Into Nice the European Union kept on fitting in the <A[constant|permanent]> committees, necessary for the <A[definition|purpose]> and <A[leadership|management]> of a common exterior and <A[security|safety]> <A[politics|policy]>: a political one and <U[Sicherheitspolisches]> committee, a <M[military committee]> as well as a European <M[military <A[stick|staff]>]>.
For this cooperation, for your support and also for the <A[photo|reception]> lasted to us thanks you, woman president, my ladies and gentlemen representatives, the French premiership.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Now we must examine the text in the parliament carefully.
I refer incidentally to that, Mr <U[Präsident]> of the European <A[Council|Advice]>, that the costs are <A[borne|carried]> by the taxpayers.
I consider <A[it|him]> as failure not only in the regard onto the ambitious aim of changing the institutions and correcting the efficiency of the European Union in order to be able to receive the new members properly announced by the European Union, but also with respect to a further important <A[objective|destination|purpose]> that was highlighted maybe too little indeed with respect to the approximation of the European Union and the citizens.
The correct questions are according to our <A[opinion|view]> those ones <A[which|who]> the impressive crowd <A[moved|touched]> which had <U[zusammengeströmt]> at the eve of the peak from whole Europe in Nice.
First the Fifteen rushed in a tear gas-impregnated atmosphere the <U[Grundrechtecharte]> signs.
(Applause)
My <A[faction|fraction]> is disappointed by this contract and worried over the future that <A[it|he]> brings us. Therefore we will fight with all strengths against that.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, you have the word.
Finally gentleman would like to answer to <U[Hager]> I, that the instrument is useful according to the increasing cooperation of my opinion in order to design Europe more dynamically and to probe the way <U[Romano Prodi]> <A[formulated|worded]> it a little while ago - I believe. I for my part approve this fully and very.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, I would like to know gladly whether the responsibility of the European parliament is a new achievement for the summer time to Nice.
Maybe the pharmaceutical enterprises up to now deterred by the complexity of the clinical <A[examinations|tests]> are encouraged to safeguarding the market for pediatric medicines to develop even if this is not large enough around the profitability of the investments by the will brought to the expression by the states as also of our parliament clearly!
. (<U[FR]>) <A[debits|quotas]> the <M[summer time <A[regulation|arrangement]>]> that was introduced for reasons of the energy saving to the <A[time|moment]> of the <M[oil crisis]> and extended to 2001 are continued?
Not always the position of the <A[victims|sacrifices]> is effectively protected in <M[<A[punishment|penalty]> procedures]>.
This European initiative will benefit therefore numerous travellers and holiday-makers.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, at the beginning I would like to greet the <M[commission president]> <U[Prodi]> that stays among us as well as the <M[<A[council|advice]> chairmanship]> that <A[just|precisely]> enters the hall and underline that in this house such unanimity was never probably yet <A[proved|shown]> in the evaluation of the results of a peak.
The Europe that is in motion is that one that achieved <A[his|its]> <A[work|job]> for all that under the French premiership in six months as seems to me in six decisive <A[fields|areas]>.
Particularly, however, I fear that Great Britain, France and Germany will be now in the situation to interrupt the sensitive balance achieved in the <A[course|process]> of decades between states of different size and between the organs.
It is heavy to recognize to what extent actually the decisions of Nice facilitate the <A[enlargement|expansion|extension]> of the <U[EU]>.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, dear colleagues and colleagues! I can do it today very much shortly.
From all this I can draw only the consequences, that I will vote with refusal if this contract should be voted on by Nice.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! The most important result of Nice was that a contract was achieved for all that and place can be created now for the <M[<A[entry|joining]> <A[candidates|nominees]>]>.
The real winners of this conference are the gentlemen Blair and <U[Aznar]>, the gentlemen, this "no" accept to Europe.
Therefore we forget Nice and let's <A[focus|do]> our looks on <U[Post-Nizza]>. Allow me to put my hope on the <A[intention|plan]> of a big convent announced by Belgium for <A[his|its]> premiership, because it proved itself: We must go new ways, we need a new method we must speed up the <A[history|story]>, because in 2004 is too late, <A[lies|is|suits]> in too wide distance, brings too many dangers with themselves.
Instead of this the spirit of Nice withstood itself obviously in that ask, <A[as|how]> one can block, how can one <U[intergouvernementalisieren]>, one can <A[make|let]> how be honored as a defender of the national interests therefore at home instead of guaranteeing for really bringing the European Union ahead.
Before what we <A[stand|are]> to Amsterdam and Nice is a Europe of the <M[<A[empire|Reich]> princes]>, a Europe of the national administrations and not Europe of the political agreement.
<A[With|In the case of]> the essential topics we can not renounce votes with qualified majority longer.
It is right that - I follow the words of Mr <U[Bayrou]> here - I am since this morning here first at the <A[page|side]> of the president of the republic, now in own thing, and from all <A[pages|sides]> it hails <A[criticisms|reviews]>, moderate, friendly <A[criticisms|reviews]>, as seems to me, but in any case <A[criticisms|reviews]>.
One must not forget that actually it is the first time since 1957, that this <A[pattern|scheme]> was really reformed or that was reshaped.
We have to do it with constitutional systems, and therefore the competences can not be mixed.
<A[Many thanks|Thanks a lot]>, Mr <U[Minister]>.
But neither <A[it|she]> was not incorporated into the contracts, nor there is not a mention of the charter in the article 6 paragraph 2 of the contract about the European Union.
To the Conclusion still some positive aspects are mentioned, for example the <M[new <A[composure|setting|version]>]> of article 7 of the contract, the article <A[about|over]> political parties and <A[their|her]> statute, the right of the parliament to sue the other organs near the court of justice - an important factor of the political control -, the new formula for the European Commission, the <A[photo|reception]> the so <U[genannten]> "<U[Lex]> <U[Prodi]>" in the contract, the <A[strengthening|refreshment]> of the president and the new composition of the commission. All that represents a <A[reasonable|sensible]> compromise that I accept and that will surely persist.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! We carried out already an uncompromising evaluation of what happened in Nice.
Let's consider the things: The charter was not picked up into the <M[contract <A[work|factory]>]>, not even a <A[tip|notice]>.
We want to prove to the heads of the government, that we it better can.
Despite the self-praise of the French premiership this morning the <M[government conference]> was not brought now to a good end.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, it is not so <A[simple|easy]> to criticize the French <M[<A[council|advice]> chairmanship]> now since <A[it|he]> is not present.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, the peak of Nice showed, that the model of the <M[government conference]> has serve.
Budget 2001 (Continuation)
That is, however, not, one would not be able to have done more and some also better not yet.
The commission is forced to set emphases in the frame of a restricted budget by such ceilings as every authority must do this.
With the vote following this pronunciation a long and complicated <A[process|trial]> of the decision ends <A[about|over]> the budget of the European Union for the year in 2001.
Therefore we went ahead as follows: Through resort to articles 272 we avoided a <M[budget crisis]>. The Financial Envisaging was maintained in spite of <A[use|commitment|insertion]> of the <M[flexibility instrument]>.
<A[Directed|Done]> onto the <A[council|advice]>, I would like to say that we will not run out of the balls so quickly during this game and that we will play for so long until we achieved the wanted result.
We do not want the resolution <U[Colom]> to contain already a <M[revision <A[proposal|suggestion]>]> for the coming year, because we want to wait for the <A[assessment|estimation]> of the World Bank, splits up, however, we <A[his|its]> <A[criticism|review]>, that a solution distorts the character of the big <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]> of the external <M[political <A[fields|areas]>]> of the union of several years and also the definition of the Financial Envisaging with respect to the financial <M[lower equipment]> of the column 4 on this way.
In order to reach all this in order to be able to fulfill our long-term <A[obligations|commitments]>, emphases must be set also in future.
Only so the money which suits us for our fellow citizens and fellow citizens for the <A[decree|disposal]> is reasonably and correctly invested.
If we already take the supplementary budget to be expected into account, it will be near almost 8 % then, during we in all other <A[fields|areas]> - it is the educational policy, it is the whole <A[field|area]> of the internal <A[politics|policy]>, including research, of the foreign policy, the administration, the <U[Vorbeitrittshilfe]> - in total only a growth rate of 1,1 % have.
Since the cooperation is so good, we will already in the January have then <A[with|in the case of]> the supplementary budget the occasion to continue <A[it|her]>.
Equally we welcome it if at the still not controlled relationships between Russia and the Baltic states <A[criticism|review]> is practiced.
With great interest we follow the social and inside-political <A[development|evolution]> of Russia.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, dear colleagues and colleagues! The common strategy for Russia was the first common strategy in the <A[history|story]> of the European Union.
Even if president <U[Putin]> guarantees the democratic <A[development|evolution]> of <A[his|its]> country opposite us, he is not in this way a guarantor automatically for a stable and democratic Russia. Nor the democratic <M[basic order]> is not lived reality in Russia.
We should not do, however, secretly, it is rather to build up a Europe of the economical cooperation necessary.
What affects the Caucasus, so Mr <U[Van Orden]> is right completely.
Who Russia considers from outside and then gets also immediate impressions of the country itself and of Russian interlocutors in too limited a fashion is in danger quickly, to declare selectively as the reality of the country what fits <A[just|precisely]> in <A[his|its]> <M[Russia picture]>.
On political field the common strategy Russia suggests to enter a <A[constant|permanent]> dialog about <A[politics|policy]> and <A[security|safety]> and to create a <A[constant|permanent]> mechanism for that.
I would like to underline with that that we must <A[make|do]> really clear the Russia in fact in a political union with <A[Belarus|Belorussia|Byelorussia]> is.
You are, Mr <U[Patten]>, ready to support such <A[intention|plan]>?
As the representatives know, a comprehensive dialog to questions of the energy was gotten going by <U[Romano Prodi]> on the last peak between the European Union and Russia.
I hope very much for my having at the beginning of the next year of occasion to go even to Kaliningrad and not only indeed, because <U[Immanuel Kant]> transferred <A[his|its]> whole life there.
I congratulate the gentleman representative again on an excellent report about an extremely important subject to which we will turn in the coming years here in the parliament surely repeatedly.
You bring me into a very difficult situation.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! I would like to say that this debate is already very much necessary, because the <M[<U[BSE]>-crisis]> has enormous effects on fodders, on building and import of fodders.
The <A[council|advice]> to achieve the <M[support group]> the <U[OSZE]> during the fulfillment of <A[their|her]> mission <A[help|assistance]> brought along <A[his|its]> concern to the expression on the occasion of <A[his|its]> numerous meetings with Russia on all levels in particular in order to persuade the Russian government to carry out independent and effective investigations of the violations of human rights in order to avoid excessive use of force as well as a possible expansion of the conflict and finally to guarantee for the transport of the humanitarian <A[help|assistance]>.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! For the rules of procedure: It is actually also usual in the house that questions which can not be answered verbally sufficiently are handed later in writing.
(Interruption of Mr <U[Posselt]>)
This guideline comes from the year 1992.
And in this sense we must work.
These groups are not, however, apparent into the new <A[proposal|suggestion]> with picked up.
The chairmanship and some member states received from the <A[association|dressing]> of the European <M[Sugar Industry]> already several writings for the <A[proposal|suggestion]> of the commission which they will consider at <A[their|her]> <A[consultations|discussions]>.
Inquiry no. 6 of (<U[H-0886]> / 00):
As First I must say that the current <M[<A[council|advice]> president]> did not answer the inquiry of gentlemen <U[Korakas]> in my opinion yet.
Now it is to fit out this authority necessary, and I believe that the European authorities of the <A[problems|problematic natures]> are very presumably conscious to themselves and that we must get on.
In order to bring it onto the point, the representative of the chairmanship is, in this case therefore the ambassador of France in Algeria, come together with gentlemen <U[M. Ahmed Taleb]>?
We welcome the <A[determinations|definitions]> suggested by the <M[preparation committee]> in this <A[connection|context]> and concluded by the general meeting of a company for the accreditation of the <M[nongovernment organizations]> for the <M[preparation <A[process|trial]>]> and for the <M[special <A[meeting|session]>]> in the September 2001.
The text on the <M[<A[entry|joining]> partnership]> contains several references to the European convention to the protection of the human rights and <M[basic freedoms]>.
As the <A[council|advice]> already in <A[his|its]> preceded <A[answer|reply]> explained opposite the representative, the <A[process|trial]> of the <A[mutual|bidirectional]> recognition of legal decisions will allow a better protection of the rights of persons.
I would like, however, <U[nachhaken]>.
<A[It|He]> takes over in particular the political control and the strategic <A[management|line|pipe]> of a military <A[use|commitment|insertion]> for the <M[crisis overcoming]>.
I would like to remind only of the system of the contract doing a difference between the <A[treatment|handling|processing]> of indirect taxes that harmonization is necessary for the establishment and the functioning of the home market - it <A[stands|is]> like this in article 93 - and the <A[approximation|adjustment]> - according to article 94 - of the <M[right rules]> that affect immediately the establishment and the functioning of the Common Market, and the direct taxes appertain to that.
I would like to say of a few words with regard to these three <M[key <A[fields|areas]>]>.
When the <M[behavior <A[pattern|sample]>]>, that in the doubt everyone fights against everyone, <A[remains|stays]>, this <A[could|might]> explode the <M[stability pact]> for <M[south Eastern Europe]> that bases <A[itself|himself]> on regional cooperation.
Finally we need also the cooperation with Yugoslavia, and a mutual cooperation indeed.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! Our <A[faction|fraction]> supports <U[Baltas]> the <A[work|job]> of gentlemen in the <A[connection|context]> with the report about the possibility of the <U[Aushandlung]> of a stabilization and association <A[agreement|convention]> with the republic of Croatia.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! In the years in which I was a president of the Parliamentary <A[meeting|assembly]> of the Council of Europe I had occasion to accompany many Croats in <A[their|her]> endeavours towards freedom and prosperity which they, as other nations of our continent, equated with <A[their|her]> integration into the European institutions.
Departing from the <A[development|evolution]> of Croatia this year, I am convinced from that that we should succeed in presenting a tight speed because exactly Croatia did that in the too <U[derückliegenden]> months.
That is anyway the approach pursued by us, and the speed with which we prepared ourselves for the <A[development|evolution]> in the last months in Croatia confirms this.
We are it the human being in Croatia guilty, that we <A[they|she|it]> and <A[their|her]> government support in the coming years in an all-round way, and we are representatives very thankful to the gentleman for <A[he|it]> recommending us to continue the taken way.
In this <A[connection|context]> it is inscrutable that in the spring of this year thousands of supporters of the jihad <M[lasing-cirque]> could move onto the <U[Molukken]> in order to heat the conflicts also there.
On Timor militias refuse the <A[refugees|fugitives]> the return and helpers are threatened.
In the name of the committee for industry, foreign sale, research and energy I would like to pay attention only to three points.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, Mr <U[Kommissar]>, admired colleagues and colleagues! First of all I the colleague <U[Maij ­]> would like to congratulate <U[Weggen]> on <A[their|her]> excellent <A[work|job]>.
In this respect it does not represent any exception.
Continuous acts of violence onto the <U[Molukken]>, in <U[Aceh]> and in Irian Jaya bring great sorrow <A[about|over]> the population.
Tomorrow the solemn <A[awarding|hiring]> of the <M[<U[Sacharow]>-price]> will occur here.
Nevertheless due to recent announcements from the Indonesian archipelago the question intrudes, whether not engraving the situation yet, for president <U[Wahid]> and <A[his|its]> combatant yes even still more precarious is, than of that one reporter described.
If we want to help Indonesia, we must do that now then with money and actions. Words alone do not suffice.
According to my <A[opinion|view]> the present report performs important <M[<A[clarification|enlightenment]> <A[work|job]>]> in this point.
It is obvious that the difficulties of the country can not be overcome from one day to the next.
Protection of the financial interests of the communities
The obstacles for <A[his|its]> independent activity, especially also in the <M[personnel recruitment]> and in <A[his|its]> structured construction, must be removed <A[at last|finally]>.
The commission must realize therefore <A[their|her]> <A[announcement|notice]> <A[at last|finally]> through an <A[internal|inner]> <M[reform <A[process|trial]>]>, that trickery is not tolerated and every fraud is pursued <A[consistently|logically]>.
I think, exactly that must be actually the consequence, also of Nice.
We welcome negotiations between the member states on the <A[approximation|adjustment]> of the <M[right <A[norms|standards]>]> in the <A[field|area]> criminality, but we would not like to shelter our countries of any federal <M[EU <U[Anklagebehörde]>]>.
In addition I would know gladly, for which the publication of the document of the commission on this topic was delayed <A[until|by]> a day after the Danish plebiscite about the euro.
I proposed to present these countries in particular because pillorying <A[it|her]> is in my opinion at the time.
I am actually <A[secure|sure]> that at that it is <A[just|precisely]> interested also to <U[OLAF]> to arrange the selection of higher managers transparently.
We must look out, however, that we overlook <A[with|in the case of]> all concentration on the problems of the commission not our own, after all nevertheless quite considerable problems. We have also problems.
We attempt, to put out the fire and smother in this case at the smoke.
Nobody can understand that, also I not.
So that this <A[objective|destination|purpose]> is reached in every relationship, I would like to pay attention to four questions which play a <A[leading|substantial]> role according to my <A[opinion|view]> during the <A[work|job]> of the <M[budgetary control authority]>.
For the parliament itself the problem is near the contract.
It makes already dubious if the <A[compliance|keeping]> of the rights of the representatives must be pointed out to the commission, woman commissioner, explicitly as <U[Hüterin]> of the contracts.
He has the possibility not to approve any <M[mid transfers]> for a certain period concerning the <M[budget lines]> in question, in particular such that aims at the increase of the <A[means|resources|funds]> used in the budget until further internal investigations are finished. He can ask even the <M[commission president]> to demand the <A[resignation|withdrawal]> from commissioners in whose environment serious problems were found - a kind of <M[EU Caesarean section]>.
The report requires <A[detailed|full]> inventories of the functional activities, thorough inspections of <M[budget lines]> and irregularities as well as commission-internal performance assessment.
Woman commissioner, the <M[EC contract]> is starting point of the transmission of information onto the European Parliament and not the Interinstitutional <A[Agreement|Arrangement]>.
The Result of this Common Point of View would be it, however, if <A[it|he]> was not changed that we at the end not only not to have any <M[<A[arm|weapon]> equality]> in the <A[relation|proportion|relationship]> to North America, but not even within Europe.
I would not know at all why here should not succeed as it succeeded <A[with|in the case of]> all other guidelines in achieving a compromise at the end.
It is a <A[proposal|suggestion]>, one long and, I fear, stormy way too <U[derückgelegt]> has overcome in order some of the existing difficulties.
The first amendment affects article 4 in which the question of the responsible inspectorate is controlled for the offer.
On the other hand the <A[proposal|suggestion]> being had by us now would bring about confusion and activate a search for the in each case most favorable venue as well as potential lawsuits to a <A[time|moment]> quite tricky during the takeover of an enterprise.
In the United Kingdom the voluntary <M[behavior codex]> prescribed by the <M[takeover committee]> persisted in the case of takeovers at best. He is a good example of how an extremely complex matter suitable for which a legal <A[regulation|arrangement]> less is well can be dealt with pragmatically.
It is, however, far more important that we should succeed in this way in bringing the task of the creation of a competitive dynamic European economy <A[formulated|worded]> in Lisbon ahead.
It goes around for us here in the European Parliament ultimately, to control the big <M[tension fields]> in the <M[takeover right]>, for the example executive board versus stockholders, major shareholders versus small shareholders, enterprises versus capital market, in a <M[least form]> in a European manner.
Through some amendments submitted by the parliament the text of the Common point of view of the <A[council|advice]> is improved when points which <A[could|might]> lead to <M[interpretation difficulties]> are referred and a <A[speedier|uninterrupted]> <A[conversion|transfer]> of the guideline is demanded.
It is not certain by any means indeed that the suggested definition of an adequate price is better than another, because the different definitions at the present time valid in the member states are absolutely <A[expressive|significant]> all.
The pronunciation is closed.
In addition an access right is awarded to the artist, to find out <A[his|its]> claims within a period of time of up to three years with a professional <M[art trader]> what is reasonable there <A[they|she|it]> over the at- and to have to lead sales book.
Accordingly the Austrian legislator is in demand here and not to attack the European legislator that creates only the general conditions positive for artists and <M[auction houses]>.
In addition the necessity of a common point of view is to be used <A[with|in the case of]> the topic which we deal with in a the larger way to itself emphatically since only one like that makes it for the European Union possible on international level for the interests of the artists being protected worldwide.
I trust in the wisdom and the farsightedness of this house.
So profited in 1998 in Germany only in 274 of 7 000 artists that had handed over <A[their|her]> rights by the <U[Folgerecht]> at which 40 % of the amount were allotted to <A[elevation|imposition|investigation|uprising]> and administration costs.
In a word, no <M[harmonization <A[need|requirement]>]> exists in this <A[field|area]>.
A similar amendment had already in first reading been refused.
One assumed the translations being able to be handed later in spite of this quite <A[packed|terse]> and difficult aging schedule.
Only we are now so far that we can not postpone this anymore unfortunately.
We suggested in the committee, this a year formerly do.
Naturally this parliament supports the mentioned values and she will defend also further.
Due to the technological <A[developments|evolutions]> as well as the changed markets a change will occur unavoidably.
There we can not find any <M[right <A[reason|bottom|ground]>]> in order to exclude the competition.
The reduction of the main item of the <M[<A[mail|post office]> sector]>, that is the <M[universal service]>, onto the transport of letter-rate items of up to a <M[<A[weight|emphasis|importance]> <A[border|boundary]>]> of 50 g would provoke for the national <M[<A[mail|post office]> operators]> seriously the danger not to be able to guarantee any <M[universal service]> for an adequate price for the <A[entire|whole]> population in all <A[regions|areas]> more.
I may remind my colleagues of the <A[conservatives|Conservatives]> in this parliament of the mess which they caused in the United Kingdom when they wanted to privatize the British <A[mail|post office]>.
From the safety net for the postcustomers we made a hammock for these large-scale enterprises of the <A[mail|post office]> that rests in that and keeps on being able to do what is still allowed them.
With this result I am very satisfied because one wanted to ignore the new technologies with the <A[concept|term]> of the specific services from the <A[field|area]> of the <M[universal service]>.
Woman president, Mr <U[Bolkestein]>, we can and will not tolerate that.
The European Commission does not suggest therefore the complete liberalization of the <A[mail|post office]> for the second <A[stage|step]> either.
I would see such future gladly also for other countries of the European Union.
Mr <U[Bolkestein]> reproached recently for the Frenchman in the Dutch press an unliberal attitude, so at least a newspaper article was entitled.
Spain, that established and used such a fund <A[could|might]> say something with regard to that, that is <A[could|might]> <A[comment|express]> on the unsure <M[right <A[basics|bases]>]> of the ground, on the virtual criteria of <A[his|its]> composition and on the <M[discretion decisions]> during <A[his|its]> <A[application|use]>.
We vote tomorrow, so I hope, for the amendment of gentlemen <U[Atkins]> and/or of Mr <U[Sterckx]>, because otherwise I would see myself led to voting against the present report.
<U[Royal]> mail is participated in this competition and distributed my letters in <U[Malmoe]>, Swede.
What did we learn from the debate or rather from the controversy which <A[superintendent|commissioner]> <U[Bolkestein]> with <A[his|its]> follow-up of a liberalization of the postal services activated at <A[absence|lack]> of any balance of the first phase and under <A[injury|violation]> of the rules planned in this guideline? We learned, that under the cloak of <A[concepts|terms]> progressive and increasing the value - as <A[about|for instance]> modernization, liberalization or support of the technological upswing - that can hide <A[disassembly|removal]> of the social quality of a country.
The planned protection of the <M[universal service]> through the <A[equipment|institution]> of an equalization fund <A[about|over]> which private operators achieve contributions to the financing of the <M[universal duties]> of the <M[<A[mail|post office]> providers]> in faraway fields will not be able to be presumably from <A[supply|existence]>.
These <A[inadequacies|deficiencies|shortcomings]> and this delay contributed also to in the debate purpose and <A[means|average]> being often confused with each other.
Woman president, during the <A[treatment|handling|processing]> of this matter we speak of the economical and social cohesion.
Woman president! Allow me as First to congratulate the reporter, Mr <U[Ferber]>, because <A[he|it]> carried out of course a complicated, difficult <A[work|job]> in the case of which he had to attempt to find the <A[compensation|balance]> between completely different <A[proposals|suggestions]>, attitudes as well as initial and target points.
I fear, the consequence will be that the present monopolists can consolidate <A[their|her]> position still further at the expense of the taxpayers and the <A[slat|batten|lath]> is applied for <M[new providers]> still a little more highly.
I am pleased with our liberal <A[fellow members|colleagues]> supporting the position of the British liberals from the other European countries.
I hold the liberalization for desirable at himself and welcome the advantages for the consumers that will result from that.
Justifies because he adapts to the logic of the memoranda of association of the European Union that puts the completion of the home market into the foreground through the free product and service traffic in a competition-certain environment.
The <A[preparation|supply]> of such a service forms the corner pillar of the <M[community <A[politics|policy]>]> in this <A[field|area]>, and all our activities are adjusted onto the improvement of this service.
The specific services are a further important <A[field|area]>, in which innovations supported and to have to be driven forward the modernization.
He passed on, he holds the opening of practically the <A[entire|whole]> postmarket for inevitable up to the end of this decade.
I enter for the <A[obligation|commitment]> for the <A[preparation|supply]> of a <M[universal service]> being stipulated irrefutably and guaranteed also in future.
For this reason can and I do not want to watch idly if the future of this sector <A[stands|is]> on the game because we do not fulfill the tasks that were assigned to us all in Lisbon properly.
<A[Many thanks|Thanks a lot]>, Mr <U[Simpson]>.
I remind you, however, of the major <A[objective|destination|purpose]> of this Common <M[Market Organization]> consisting in safeguarding an <M[<A[access|entrance]> <A[guarantee|warranty]>]> to <A[their|her]> products for the shared market.
Fortunately we could achieve unanimity ultimately in the <U[Agrarausschuss]>. For that I thank my colleagues as well as Mr <U[Fernández Martín]>, author of the comment of the committee for <A[development|evolution]> and cooperation, for <A[their|her]> support.
For example we must bring also furthermore our concern because of the <M[banana production]> in certain <U[AKP-Ländern]>, in the small countries of origin of the Antilles and in some countries of <M[west Africa]>, which are traditional <M[delivering-countries]> on the <M[banana market]> and opposite which we have <A[obligations|commitments]> which we must not forget to the expression.
Therefore I ask for this report being supported in <A[his|its]> entirety, just the same as in the <M[agriculture committee]>, of the members of this parliament.
The historical <M[reference periods]> had been refused by the USA initially, in the meantime a solution with own historical <M[reference periods]> becomes, however, approves.
Strong interests, in particular the ones of the Americans, that even none indeed of <M[banana peasant]> are, who, however, put American capital into the <A[trading companies|commercial enterprises]>, play a role.
Sometimes it shines as if the commission were away of us even further <A[with|in the case of]> the <A[proposals|suggestions]> for the deregulation in the <A[trade|commerce]> and in the agricultural production in the international <A[standard|scale]> as the <M[<U[Cairns]>-group]>.
Unfortunately commission and <A[council|advice]> insist on a solution which can endanger this production seriously in particular after 2006.
In the different <M[WTO-decisions]> it does not mean that we must grant any <M[preference <A[regulations|arrangements]>]> to our traditional <M[delivering-countries]>.
The <M[transition time <A[room|space]>]> should therefore about fifteen years, at least, however, been ten years. In addition the <M[<A[compensation|balance]> aids]> must include an <M[<A[income|revenue]> <A[guarantee|warranty]>]> for the <M[community producers]> and the <A[sale|heel|paragraph]> of the production of the fields in utmost <M[edge situation]>, which contains accordingly also a <A[help|assistance]> for the <A[facilities|institutions]> which there produced bananas commercialize.
I hopes, she listens now to our arguments, because the system of the <M[customs preference]> suggested by the commission, even if it is set on 300 euros <A[could|might]> prove, to be in reality quite ineffective, there the <M[<U[AKP]> producers]> through the so called <M[greyhound procedure]> brake become.
Votes
(The parliament approves of the <A[proposal|suggestion]> of the commission. )
The commission refuses the remaining amendments.
Before the vote:
(The parliament accepts the verbal amendment. )
Report (A5-0383 / 2000) of Ms <U[Morgan]> in the name of the committee for budgetary control <A[about|over]> the reform of the budgetary control procedure and authority (2000 / 2008 (<U[INI]>))
Most smokers are not either <A[about|over]> the full risk or <A[about|over]> the consequences of <A[their|her]> <A[actions|conducts]> in the clarity.
I always stuck to that in my long parliamentary life of now 35 years.
I fear, however, that this hope is futile.
This is our last attempt to clarify the actual consequences of the smoking through labels and photographs on the <M[cigarette <A[packages|packings]>]>.
Report back (A5-0368 / 2000)
This is an <A[assessment|estimation]> which I still hold for relevant and correct. Subsequently I voted against the report in <A[his|its]> entirety.
The committee for right and home market is right completely if <A[it|he]> insists on the refusal of the upper limit and on a minimum which must not lie under 7 %.
With <A[their|her]> vote against this guideline my <A[faction|fraction]> would like to set also a political <M[<A[respect|attention|caution]> sign]> in this respect when we must not <A[stay|delay]> in the European Union with issuing superfluous regulations.
As a matter of course the former <U[stalinistische]> dictatorship must be condemned, however <A[as|how]> also only the least confidence can give Mr <U[Putin]> one, this hangman of the <U[tschetschenischen]> nation, this godfather of different <M[Mafia organizations]>, this head of state that would like to <A[remove|eliminate]> any opposition and the <M[<A[civil|civilian]> society]> (Trade unions, political parties), around <A[his|its]> own power to <A[fortify|strengthen]>?
Actually Indonesia would not earn such intensification of the relationships especially, because in the last years the ruling ones of this country were not characterized <A[just|precisely]> by a high measure of democracy or great <A[merits|incomes]> going along, however, we must have also the Indonesian citizens in the eye, for which we welcome this intensification of the relationships and this <A[help|assistance]>.
This <A[unit|unity]> may deal only with criminal actions which were inspected by <M[EU employees]>.
. (<U[FR]>) The report <U[Theato]> about the <M[fraud abatement]> makes the <A[determination|statement]> for us possible, that the European Central Bank has considered, certainly for the better <A[evidence|proof]> of <A[their|her]> a lot quoted independence, an <A[entry|joining]> for the <A[agreement|arrangement]> on the office for <M[fraud abatement]> (<U[OLAF]>) not for reasonable.
In this way the vote is ended.
We must realize that there are only two possibilities: Either we belong for this purpose, or we do not belong for this purpose.
Loves colleagues and colleagues, you do not give us any <A[reason|occasion]> for a change of name.
The pure <A[inch system|tariff system]> is, however, an important element which guarantees for the balance of the <M[commission <A[proposal|suggestion]>]> and which represents an important basis for that so that one can get on anyway in the <A[council|advice]>.
Measures for the marketing of these bananas are in addition found in the national and regional programs to the promotion of the <A[development|evolution]> of the rural <A[room|space]>.
Europe and the United States work closely together during the defense of our common values.
We will probably talk also <A[about|over]> a new <M[WTO-round]> as well as <A[about|over]> the effects of the numerous new bilateral <M[commercial initiatives]> onto this <M[WTO-round]> which people discuss about currently in the American hemisphere.
<A[It|He]> referred to the trans-Atlantic relationships being expanded in the last ten years considerably and this being to be owed particularly to the efforts by president Clinton on American <A[page|side]>. I think, however, that in the history books of a day it will be also noted down that for these new relationships also Europe with the Trans-Atlantic <A[declaration|explanation]> achieved of 1990 and with the Trans-Atlantic agenda under the Spanish <M[<A[council|advice]> premiership]> in the December 1995 an important contribution which had <A[leading|substantial]> part at the success of these relationships.
Therefore, importantly it will be to carry out an <U[Umsteuerung]> here and to write in fact a Trans-Atlantic agenda for the year 2001.
I would like to quote still the <A[statement|testimony]> to the end from representatives of the Dominican Republic: "This an impartial arbitration board that guarantees for the common regulations being kept and the countries being able to <U[vertraut machen]> with the free world trade should be WTO initial.
Secondly we can be pleased indeed with the downfall of the communist swindling, but after the <A[breakdown|collapse]> of the Soviet Union only an only superpower remained, the USA indeed.
I know that <A[it|he]> maintains a successful and very constructive dialog with the parliament and the committees which are involved in these topics.
<A[According to|After]> the agenda the common pronunciation follows <A[about|over]> following reports:
These <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]>, the main aim and the secondary <A[objectives|destinations|purposes]>, will be the touchstone at which the <A[concrete|actual]> <A[proposals|suggestions]> presented by the commission must be judged.
As is generally known such solution - <A[equipment|institution]> only in a country with possibility of the provision of services in the <A[entire|whole]> union - <A[could|might]> activate an avalanche in those countries with a lower taxation.
In this case indeed the <M[standard measure <A[sentence|set]>]> was not allowed to fall below 15 %, nevertheless the member states received the right to use a or several <M[least <A[sentences|sets]>]> of not less than 5 % <A[with|in the case of]> which there are <M[exception <A[regulations|arrangements]>]> in this case in the meantime planned.
We called the European Commission for the supervision in order to guarantee that there is not any <M[market distortion]> and that the <A[council|advice]> and the parliament are taught.
In a word the request of this <A[proposal|suggestion]> is correct, but the method was designed <A[wrong|false]>, and if we really want to support the electronic economy of Europe, a <M[value added tax liberation]> of our own <U[e-Unternehmen]> would be then and not the attempt to broadcast our problems to others, the correct signal for that.
In order to be able to fulfill the demands for a decrease of the <M[hothouse gas <A[emissions|issues]>]>, we must take all possible measures for <A[their|her]> <A[limitation|limit]>.
The only case, where up to now yet no tax is raised, is that one if from a third country into the European Community people deliver.
The positive discrimination of the air traffic must be ended.
On the other hand to become enterprise from third countries not taxed.
<U[CDs]> are not very outmoded, nevertheless are supposed to be taxed, however, while <A[about|over]> the Internet available programs are being supposed to be released from the tax!
Nevertheless may the suggested solution as technical not movably and when prove hindrance for the <A[development|evolution]> of the <M[internet transactions]> in the European Union, although nevertheless all those one expansion long.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, dear ladies and gentlemen! The <A[tax systems|control systems]> of the union become toothless and lose <A[productivity|fruitfulness]>.
We should think out possibilities as we can support the electronic businesses and no new methods <A[make|let]> us come in as we can tax <A[it|him]>.
The liberals represent the basic principle "so little state how possible", at which the USA are led as an example.
The <M[<U[Primarolo]>-group]> elaborated <A[simple|easy]> rules which must be turned over.
As an objection the <A[faction|fraction]> represented by me in this parliament thinks that the fact should be corrected.
There can be a taxation of kerosene therefore in order to guarantee <M[competition equality]> only in the international consensus.
In particular I welcome the fact that the report that this parliament some months ago approved underpinned one of the most important of the comments <A[found|hit]> by me in my report for the committee for traffic and tourism and indeed, that we, as long as it is politically difficult without doubts to come to an international <A[agreement|arrangement]> <A[about|over]> the taxation from aviation fuel, in order to achieve the same effect, at least at short notice alternative instruments should check under that also an <M[<A[emission|issue]> <A[delivery|output]>]>.
In fact the branch to 100 % pays through <M[air-traffic control <A[deliveries|outputs]>]> and <M[airport <A[fees|charges]>]> for <A[their|her]> <M[infrastructure costs]> that amounted to 4 billion United States dollars in 1998 - in the contrast to other traffic carriers as e.g. rail and street traffic, that are subsidized still strongly.
The present situation is disadvantageous.
In the <A[connection|context]> one must state unfortunately that nevertheless there is a problem at the <A[emissions|issues]> of air traffic even if that is not so large in percent, but it increases very much strongly, and therefore one should not talk it in a small way.
This plan becomes for the <A[development|evolution]> of the <U[KMU]> within as to be harmful outside of the union, in particular faced with the suggested <A[lowering|reduction]> of the threshold value for a liberation of the tax onto an unbearably low level of the annual turnover of 40 000.
If we are too eager in the question to be handled now, we endanger in fact the future of the electronic businesses, important for Europe.
The starting point, after which a renderer of a service of services with seat in a third country that delivers to a customer in the community only at a single place register to need to <A[make|let]>, must not lead to a shift from tax yields between the member states.
Since the discussion is still in the <A[council|advice]> in the <A[walk|corridor|running]> and among other things faced with the aim of the commission, to bring the topic value added tax and electronic businesses at short notice to a successful end, it <A[seems|appears]> <A[present|present-day]> to me at the most reasonable not to accept the amendments of the parliament formally yet, but to attempt to get <A[it|her]> through at the <A[consultations|discussions]> in the <A[council|advice]> so far as possible.
Therefore I can not take over the suggested changes.
I thank you many times for your taking care of different topics in this week of all these.
The commission perceived only three months <A[for her part|for their part]> <A[according to|after]> the misfortune <A[their|her]> responsibility and a first <M[measure <A[parcel|bundle]>]> to be confirmed by the European Parliament on the 30th November without limit says goodbye.
In Fact it is to be prevented <A[with|in the case of]> more than fifteen valid guidelines or <A[regulations|ordinances|prescriptions]> urgently necessarily to standardize the practices and to carry out a stronger control of the <A[application|use]> of the <M[community <A[norms|standards]>]> around where appropriate the <A[appearance|manner|occurrence]> of considerable and unacceptable differences in the <A[field|area]> of the <A[security|safety]> in the sea traffic in the union.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! I thank the Ms <U[De Palacio]> for <A[their|her]> continuous engagement on the field of the <M[ship <A[security|safety]>]>.
I would like to remind the ladies and gentlemen of <A[with|in the case of]> the <A[security|safety]> in the air traffic the <U[Entschädigungen]> used in the European <A[field|area]> and in the <A[field|area]> of the USA not agreeing with the amounts used in other countries.
Secondly I would like to say to you that it is the French justice that would have the possibility, the <A[means|resources|funds]> of a <A[concrete|actual]> <A[society|company]> to confiscate or freeze, around <U[Entschädigungen]> for damages or Other pay, that <A[could|might]> define a <A[liability|adhesion]> that exceeds the amount that is planned to the current international <A[regulation|arrangement]> above <A[pollution|soiling]> by mineral oils <A[according to|after]> the objective criteria.
The commission thinks that these steps go into the correct direction and lead to the creation of juster <M[<A[delivery|output]> systems]> which also stimuli offer for a more <A[reasonable|sensible]> and more efficient use of the road network.
Faced with the <A[criticism|review]>, in particular from Ireland and France, it resulted then in this change, and now the matter of the British Minister of Finance receives a completely new turn: <A[It|She]> is represented now as <M[consumer <A[delivery|output]>]> for all, therefore also for British <M[TRUCK drivers]>.
I am obliged to safeguard that the food suiting the consumers for the <A[decree|disposal]>, whether <A[they|she|it]> now from the European Union or from outside come to meet highest <A[requirements|requests]>.
I understand of course the concern of the gentleman representative.
Mr <U[Kommissar]>, I must say unfortunately to you that your <A[answer|reply]> does not suffice to me.
The one Delegated by the gentleman addressed point is very important.
In Nigeria <U[Chevron]> is accused by the ethnic group of the <U[Ijaw]>, put up to the violence against this nation and paid even Nigerian soldiers for having, to bombard demonstrators at the naval base <U[Warri]>.
In <A[their|her]> on the 15th November accepted report the commission to the conclusion came, that through the <M[<A[company|operation]> aid]> according to <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]> 1540 / 98 no solution of the problem of the south-Korean <M[price practices]> could be found.
I believe, the <A[intentions|purposes]> in <A[their|her]> entirety are extremely calming, the reality looks, however, like this that meanwhile our shipyards close.
Inquiry no. 38 of (<U[H-0868]> / 00):
Mr <U[Kommissar]>, I can understand that you would not like to change <A[their|her]> decision although ten member states refuse such customs.
This initiative is based on a <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]> of the <A[council|advice]> for the change of the <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]> which the current <U[APS]> defines.
I represent some <M[sugar beet peasant]> and am therefore in fact very much worried.
This <A[work|job]> occurs in the committee <A[with|in the case of]> which <A[it|she]> had to turn out this week since <U[Poul Nielson]> is on a <M[Balkans journey]>.
We work <A[just|precisely]> on the <M[protection <A[stipulation|clause]>]>, and if Mr <U[Clegg Argumente]> <A[needs|requires]> for the conversations with <A[his|its]> <M[sugar beet peasants]>, <A[it|he]> can be directed at any time to me so.
I would like to thank gentlemen <U[Liikanen]> for an in every respect very much positive and good <A[answer|reply]>.
I will discuss this question with my offices as soon as the question of the <M[budget <A[means|resources|funds]>]> is clarified for the next year.
My offices and I myself are at the present time called in for restricting the consequences resulting from the geographical <A[distance|removal]> between the <M[<A[process|trial]> parties]> and the future <A[court|dish]>.
Just the same, the <A[courts|dishes]> in <U[Düsseldorf]>, Munich and elsewhere in Germany onto the <A[patent right|patent law]> have specialized - and there is also such a specialized <A[court|dish]> in London -, also a <A[court|dish]> of the community that comes together and decides on cases that affect <M[community patents]> would have to be very specialized.
Not to designate national <U[Gemeinschaftsmarkengerichte]> in this way such a <A[provisional|temporal|temporary]> situation <U[verstetigt]>, the commission reminded in a writing the affecting member states of <A[their|her]> duty of the 13th July of former year.
As the Mr <U[Abgeordnete]> knows, the submitting of a complaint does not have any influence on the progress of the project at itself.
Inquiry no. 47 of (<U[H-0877]> / 00):
The commission does therefore of the <A[their|her]> too commandments standing appeals only in the sense use planned in the <A[regulation|ordinance|prescription]>.
The question who the studying ones must be directed to in order to be able to be sure says, however, that the completing of this course of studies and <A[his|its]> end in Great Britain lends them the right to recognition of <A[their|her]> <M[study results]>.
One of the most creditable Finnish members of the parliament <A[could|might]> be elected as the limited king for example.
The whole can be considered also as a <M[competition question]>, there in the southern Baltic Sea, on the Stockholm <A[stretch|distance]> - Helsinki, to whom <M[<U[Tax]>-<U[Free]> sale]> is kept on being allowed while it is being forbidden between <U[Umeå]> and <U[Vaasa]>.
We must absolutely correct this situation through the promotion and support of multilingual contents because this is completely decisive for the success of the European <M[contents industry]>.
It is a question in this case particularly of the problem that small enterprises present guarantees not always sufficient to investors and can refer them to a sound <M[enterprise <A[development|evolution]>]> for me.
In order to bring the ambitious <A[intention|plan]> of this European <M[<U[eContent]>-program]> to a successful end, the planned procedures must be simplified and protected.
Therefore it must be an <A[objective|destination|purpose]> of the public <M[supporting-measures]> for the shared <M[contents industry]> to achieve also a high <M[<A[education|formation]> level]> and a cultural variety.
To the other one there are the communications networks which are dependent on the contents in order to fill <A[their|her]> virtual <A[room|space]> unstoppably. To hold you in turn it for natural, to subject these contents, to be able to buy it up and be useful without special regard for the <M[production rules]>.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, I welcome this program <U[eContent]> very much and would like to <A[make|do]> onto two points of view attentive.
Therefore I support the amendments in which the realization of specific measures is demanded in the <A[field|area]> of the new technologies.
Firstly for the social and cultural function of the digital contents: Here the commission welcomes that the parliament accentuates the social and cultural aspect of the digital contents.
Evaluation and abatement of <M[<A[surroundings|environment]> noise]>
In Fact I am thankful for that, that the Christian Democrats as well as <A[after all|by the way]> also a part of the Liberal <A[Faction|Fraction]> this a <A[concrete|actual]> amendment, to restrict the noise caused through airplanes already now, to have supported.
Only now, 6 years later and onto <A[constant|continual]> pushing of the French government, the commission made <A[their|her]> <A[proposal|suggestion]> for European harmonized <M[noise indexes]>.
That is a moderate <A[proposal|suggestion]>. In the Scandinavian countries today already more <A[severe|austere]> standards are valid than they are suggested for the year 2012.
<U[Orly]>, <U[Shiphol]>, Barcelona and other airports suffice for already <A[severe|austere]> standards.
Another important point which was brought in by us and which will be essential <A[just|precisely]> in the <A[connection|context]> with the <A[problems|problematic natures]> of the aircraft noise is that there are still supposed to be additional <M[noise indexes]> next to the <M[noise indexes]> named by the reporter.
Since it does not give any common To Normalize in the European Union, it resulted here in a manifest <M[competition distortion]> between airports and to the <U[Ungleichbehandelung]> of citizens of different member states.
Therefore the amendments of my opinion submitted by my colleague <U[Bernd Lange]> are so important.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, first I must say that I welcome this report.
That was the idea of the amendment Nr. 36 in the basic principle although I believe that this idea is not yet finally thought out.
We should check that very carefully and create then combined approach, limit values for the <A[single|individual]> <M[<A[emission|issue]> <A[sources|springs]>]> and on the other hand <M[quality standards]> for the <A[emissions|issues]> on both levels.
We needed more time, and I regret that we did not have these <A[even|also]> if I support the guideline in the general one.
As soon as the member states presented <A[comparable|corresponding]> information, the commission will discuss about the question of the <M[community limit values]> and other measures in order to reduce the <M[noise exposure]>, and will report then the <A[council|advice]> and the parliament on that.
Other <M[food additives]> than dyes and <U[Süßungsmittel]>
These are the three criteria.
<A[Many thanks|Thanks a lot]>, Mr <U[Kollege]>. I am similarly: You have a dry mouth, and I have a frog in the neck as we say with ourselves, but here the flu goes around a little bit.
Chronic <M[<A[feeding|nutrition]> problems]> increase furthermore the <M[cancer risk]>.
Then it was also <A[proved|shown]> that the commission did not have the correct instruments in order to introduce suitable measures.
Tomorrow already the next stage <A[stands|is]> on the plan. Then Ms <U[Kollegin Marit Paulsen]> of the <M[<U[ELDR]>-<A[faction|fraction]>]> <A[is|sits]> in the saddle and improving the present guideline still further has the possibility.
The member states and now a better instrument for the <A[decree|disposal]> suits the commission in order to guarantee that the <M[community rules]> are put through for the <M[animal <A[feeding|nutrition]>]> properly and during the <A[entry|incidence]> of emergencies in third countries a rapid reacting is possible.
We know that the predominant majority of the Europeans lives in cities, and up to now in particular these questions were handled <U[stiefmütterlich]>.
The <M[planning <A[process|trial]>]> must be turned over honestly and innovatively.
The <M[increase year program]> 2000-2004 for the lasting <M[city <A[development|evolution]>]> is a suitable instrument for that, and the <A[conversion|transfer]> of the agenda 21 represents an excellent <A[means|average]> to the coordination and realization of actions.
Less transportations and the exit of fossil combustibles on local level are unavoidable if we want to achieve a change during the current <M[climate threat]>.
Many thought that the <M[finance frame]> is too small.
<M[Main partners]> in this frame are supposed to be, however, the commission and the nets of the local regional authorities which are juridically responsible for the <A[adquisition|working out]> and enforcement of the measures on the field of the lasting <M[city <A[development|evolution]>]>.
The court of justice of the communities and even the <M[quarrel settlement committees]> the WTO are the <A[opinion|view]> that the <M[<A[provision|precaution]> principle]> can absolutely come in the <M[environmental <A[field|area]>]> or in the <A[field|area]> of the national health for the <A[application|use]>, separated even against the Europeans, as the pendant procedure shows to the <M[raw milk cheese]>.
Not <M[damage <A[limitation|limit]>]> or compensation must be the <A[objective|destination|purpose]>, it must be the <A[uppermost|supreme]> <A[objective|destination|purpose]> to prevent damages at the health or at <U[Hab]> and <A[good|property]> of the people.
In after all already 1996 the European parliament approved a <A[prohibition|ban]> of the use of meat and bone flour in agreement with the <M[<A[provision|precaution]> principle]> in the <A[entire|whole]> European Union - one would have nevertheless only...
There is not absolute scientific <A[security|safety]> <A[about|over]> new <A[materials|cloths]> or products and there will never be it.
If the <M[<A[provision|precaution]> principle]> efficiently and credibly is supposed to be used, it is finally important to include all <M[main <A[participants|people involved]>]>, also representatives of the <M[<A[civil|civilian]> society]>, in the political decisions which are made in the frame of the <A[application|use]> of the principle.
And finally the national health and the environment <A[in front of|before]> other considerations, <A[in front of|before]> everything economical, must have the <A[priority|precedence]>.
The basic requirement for the resort to the <M[<A[provision|precaution]> principle]> <A[consists|exists]>, that the apprehension, harmful consequences <A[could|might]> kick in, scientifically reasonable is.
Professor <U[George Carlo]>, an American that the <U[Food and Drugs]> charged administration an investigation in the last seven years <A[about|over]> the effect from radiations the human health, informed of in Lisbon, has <A[first|only]> yesterday the risk would withstand it, that the use of mobile telephones the <A[appearance|manner|occurrence]> of <M[brain tumors]>, the <M[<U[Alzheimer]> illness]> and from <M[skin damages]> increases.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, environment and national health are as a complicated machine with many functions that we control and control in order to be able to intervene so that no disaster happens.
During the <A[application|use]> of this principle it must be prevented in any case that the innovation and the economic activity are hampered that it too to <U[derückhaltung]> and standstill in the industry comes and that the competition is avoided in this way.
It might not have escaped the parliament that the commission agrees with most questions raised in your <M[resolution <A[request|application]>]>.
The vote occurs tomorrow at 10.00 o'clock.
The right to lives is strengthened in <A[their|her]> article 2. And always, if the terrorism claims human lives in Spain, the <A[entire|whole]> European Union feels hurt in one of <A[their|her]> most essential basic principles.
We do not want to replace the <A[lawfully|legitimately]> created institutions, but they would <A[insist|pass]>, to protect our rights and our freedoms without giving in to the terror.
Votes
<A[It|She]> reminded in this case of the <A[comments|annotations|notes]> of the <A[council|advice]> to the <A[classification|division]> of the <M[budget lines]> concerning the <M[early retirement project]> <A[with|in the case of]> the commission and the administrative operating expenditures in the <A[connection|context]> with the <M[<A[fishing|fishery]> descendants]>.
(The parliament accepts the legislative resolution. )
I think that is not more up-to-date!
These will consider 23 428 permissions indeed as too little, welcome the <M[growth possibilities]> offered to them, however.
This extinction that became effective from middle of the last year led - foreseen as of us - to a dramatic slow-down of the permission from <A[intentions|plans]> and the carrying out of payments. In the result of that the annual carrying out of <M[mid <A[links|obligations]>]> of this ground lay at the end of June 2000 <A[with|in the case of]> less than a <M[percent point]>.
This text is an ideal charter for a practical closing of the <M[general <A[secretary's office|secretariat]>]> of the European Parliament in Luxembourg.
Before my departure they said to me: "Christmas stands at the door, and to celebrate we in <U[Bergamo]> the <M[Christmas celebration]> and the celebration of the saints <U[Lucia]>.
Our <U[vehemente]> <A[criticism|review]> in addition turns against the overproduction of farm products as well as on the other hand, that the EU uses information mediums in order to sell this surplus.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, I voted for the report <U[García-Margallo y Marfil]> about the added value tax <A[treatment|handling|processing]> of certain electronically produced services.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, I will attempt, that still to <A[take|create]> <A[remedy|relief]> to Malta before 2004 with some <A[declarations|explanations]>.
I want to say, however, with a certain ceremony, that this the maximum of that was, what I can accept in a Europe that is too liberal from my <A[view|sight]>!
A <M[period of time settlement]> would motivate the <A[mail|post office]>, <A[their|her]> services to develop and to modernize as soon as the planning and investments facilitate.
You will keep on exerting pressure. They fortify <A[their|her]> position with the money which they earn from the delivery above the <M[150-gram-<A[border|boundary]>]>.
The liberalization of the postal services in the form suggested by the commission is not either adequate or homogeneous. Therefore I voted for the report and all explained changes which went into this direction.
Tell <U[de Roo]> (A5-0378 / 2000)
Also we have Nr. 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31 against the amendments our reservations, because we are not convinced by that, that <A[they|she|it]> are with the rules the WTO compatible.
Against a globalization which infringes upon the most elementary human rights.
That would <A[stand|be]> in the <A[contradiction|discrepancy]> to the <A[respect|attention|caution]> of the national identity (Article 6 paragraph 3 of the <M[union contract]>).
It is to be emphasized that the <M[language minorities]> were not overwhelmed by the globalization of the Internet, but found new possibilities of a cultural and economical opening in that.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, for lack of other results the <U[Gefeilsche]> disclosed at least the <A[intentions|purposes]> of the protagonists of the European Union in Nice.
The tenor, the common <M[resolution <A[request|application]>]> underlying, is much too one-sided in this respect.
The delay during the publication of the written conclusions - that also now are not officially available after four days yet - explains how in a difficult way it is to bring decisions that were understood in a general jumble to paper clearly.
The only way in order to avoid dangerous conflicts for the future it is to stay during the traditional conception after which Europe is based on the <A[mutual|reciprocal]> <A[respect|attention|caution]> of the national communities.
The peak of Nice ended on the Sunday with an <A[agreement|arrangement]> which is supposed to lead to a <M[contract draft]>.
The <M[resolution <A[request|application]>]> today made for the vote to Nice does not reflect this.
Closing another remark on the social policy that France wanted to tackle during the <A[idea|presentation]> of <A[his|its]> premiership. Ultimately it remained now next to the letters of intent and melodious, with regard to the contents vague documents which are completely inadequate faced with the existing problems and the great dissatisfaction as it was expressed also by the employees in Nice impressively at a handful of trifles.
Apparently <A[with|in the case of]> the really important topics - as taxes, <A[deliveries|outputs]>, social policy, <A[asylum|shelter]> and immigration - everything remained with the old man.
Impressing at the pronunciation to Nice the <A[idea|presentation]> that the contract does not have either mother or father ultimately is - he is not anybody's child. The French <M[<A[council|advice]> premiership]> indulged in <U[Ausflüchten]> instead of bearing the results of the <M[government conference]> and the reasons for that <A[unequivocally|unambiguously]>.
In the opposite, the influence of the national democracies decreases because the <A[right of veto|veto power]> keeps on being restricted and the European Parliament receives more power.
One had foreseen these effects in the year in which I was born, therefore 1944, <A[with|in the case of]> the end of the <A[agreement|convention]> from Chicago, it would not have been arranged then at that time probable to exclude aviation fuel and <A[other|sundry]> <M[airplane <A[need|requirement]>]> from the taxation.
Since there is not a <M[zero risk]>, the scientists or at least the politicians must use the criterion of the commensurability, to consider uncertain risks and to be raked to <A[their|her]> responsibility.
This parliament fought, however, also for this reduction of the <A[means|resources|funds]> standing for the innovative measures for the <A[decree|disposal]> being compensated by use of the <M[flexibility frame]>, <A[held|kept]> in a <A[declaration|explanation]> for the Financial Envisaging.
On this important field all a role must take over, there it on this truly global market on which we move now, the new ideas are - correctly financed, convincingly and realistically underpinned -, <A[which|who]> will safeguard, that we can claim our place in Europe at the top of the technical <A[development|evolution]> in the new branches of industry and in particular in the communication technology.
Already serious words were said with regard to the question of the <M[budget <A[means|resources|funds]>]> here in the preceding <M[speech contribution]>: 400 million euros are in fact only a minimum for the financing, and in the second half the possibilities of additional financing offered through the <M[flexibility instrument]> must be able to be used as in the report was represented.
In this way must my opinion's also, not as the report concludes, to go around automatically the loss at European added value.
How we all know is the unemployment in the European Union at the highest in the economically and technologically less developed <A[regions|areas]>, in particular into that one <A[Objective|Destination|Purpose]>-1-Demand. The innovative measures may not only technological kind, but must be taken also from the explicit will, to support economy and <A[employment|activity|occupation]>.
When I now too <U[derück]> into my own <A[region|area]>, therefore to <M[east England]>, goes and finds, that a single regional authority did not use this money in the last period, then I doubt, whether we were as effective as we must be in future so that we can call new communes welcome.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, first of all I would like to thank Mr <U[Helmuth Markov]> for <A[his|its]> constructive and extremely <A[competent|qualified]> explanations to the draft for a <A[communication|notification]> <A[about|over]> the innovative measures of the <U[EFRE]> in the period 2000-2006 and express <A[him|her]> my recognition.
The <M[energy efficiency]> and environment-political aspects have <A[their|her]> place in these guidelines. You can be a <A[reason|occasion]> for innovative actions on the third topic to affect the regional <A[development|evolution]> and the lasting <A[development|evolution]>.
We would like, however, that these projects are selected on regional level as Mr <U[Nous Berend]> very presumably understood in <A[his|its]> contribution.
The pronunciation is closed.
Therefore we demand in this report and in the three <A[requests|applications]> that <A[besides|in addition]> were submitted that the commission <A[their|her]> efforts, to be put through the WTO, reinforced, an international <M[quarrel grievance procedure]> before.
It seems to me that the responsible commissioner must show opposite the branch that everything undertakes it in order to counter this external danger for our branch.
Finally we expect that the <M[shipbuilding-<A[accord|agreement]>]> is discussed on the meeting of the group 6 of the OECD on the 18th December.
It looks, however, like that as if the final spurt is postponed again and again a little bit so that we never reach the target line.
As you all know, only the introduction of the procedure will use more than six months.
For the large company groups as for <A[their|her]> political attorneys the demand for less state only means that the state and <A[his|its]> finances are supposed to suit them exclusively for the <A[decree|disposal]>.
However for this purpose, now so that the shipbuilding industry and the jobs consolidates and <A[security|safety]> can be given to the families, dependent on the sector, aids are necessary beyond the 31st December 2000, because the market situation is shaped not by equal opportunity, but by unfair competition and dumping.
The improvement of the competitive capacity of the <M[EU shipyards]> is supported by the commission, however, faced with the massive <U[Preisunterbietung]> through the Korean shipyards the <A[accessible|attainable]> <M[productivity <A[progress|headway]>]> is not sufficient.
The <A[council|advice]> stressed, that this <M[support mechanism]> must not distort the competition within the <U[EU]>.
The presence of the crashed <M[atomic-submarine]> in the waters of the bay of <U[Algeciras]> grew now unfortunately into a diplomatic conflict between a military atomic and colonial power and a member state of second category that does not demand <A[his|its]> rights and submits to infantile <A[declarations|explanations]> as the last classification of Nice says.
When through the medical report, that was spread in the country of the owner - that is, through the British press -, that became known to <A[weight|gravity|heaviness]> of the illness, no <A[transfer|placing]> into another clinic, but a change of the <A[classification|division]> of the clinic occurred.
We expect of course the <A[answer|reply]> of the commission with interest in order to find out whether the <A[objective|destination|purpose]> was reached.
Mr <U[Präsident]>! Also I would like to bring at the beginning my <A[interest|sympathy]> and my disgust to the family of the murdered district council and the colleagues of the people's party <A[about|over]> this fascistic barbarism of the <U[ETA]> and <A[their|her]> accomplices to the expression.
I hold it also for advisable, the submarine <U[Tireless]> extremely fast, as soon as the corresponding climatic conditions are given, to transfer for the repair to Great Britain.
The representatives asked whether the commission thinks that the guideline 89 are / 618 / Euratom <A[about|over]> the <A[information|instruction]> of the population in a radiological <M[state of emergency situation]> and the guideline 96 / 29 / Euratom for the <A[determination|definition]> of the basic <M[<A[security|safety]> <A[norms|standards]>]> in the regard onto this submarine applicable and which steps were introduced accordingly.
We are not entitled in spite of our being able to say generally, which says it, in the frame of the usual <M[complaint procedure]> to make this <A[answer|reply]> public.
There is an aspect of the <M[Euratom-contract]>, that is the transportation of contaminated waste between the member states of the European Union. Gibraltar belongs now, however, to the United Kingdom, and contaminated waste would be transported into another part of the country from a part of the United Kingdom without passing another member state of the European Union in this case.
Spain needs only the confidence of the people to winning on the rock.
Here we have now a member state that deals with the public of another member state the way <A[it|he]> would do that with every other state to the world as if there were not fifty years after the beginning of the European <M[agreement <A[work|factory]>]> of any <U[affectio societatis]> as if the European solidarity would not have done the least <A[progress|headway]>.
In fact a German submarine operated in British waters to a certain <A[time|moment]> as only one.
There debates, however, the citizens <A[focus|do]> <A[their|her]> attention on the European institutions consciously or intuitively.
Due to the <A[shortenings|cuts]> which were carried out by the <U[Labourregierung]> in the <M[defense budget]> less <A[means|resources|funds]> to the purchase of new military device stand for the <A[decree|disposal]> so that in the future reinforced cases are to be reckoned in which defective <A[technique|technology]> must be set for absolutely necessary repairs retiredly.
The responsibility of the community ­ as maybe very much also some wants this very differently ­ extends neither onto the classification of <A[harbors|ports]> for the realization of repair works at submarines nor onto the questions of the technical <A[security|safety]> of nuclear reactors or on demands that a submarine must be brought to the repair elsewhere.
In order to be able to help them still better with increasing the financial, staff and material <A[means|resources|funds]> of the <U[UNHCR]>, one would have to ask to the <M[community institutions]>.
I ask the commission to increase the <M[finance <A[help|assistance]>]> for the <U[UNHCR]> again as well as to show in all <A[their|her]> descendants with the <U[NRO]> the <U[UNHCR]> always as a <M[coordination organ]>.
It must have therefore <A[access|entrance]> to the civilian <A[victims|sacrifices]>, and <A[his|its]> teams on site must surely be able to move and have the necessary resources for the fulfillment of <A[their|her]> mission.
On the 22nd November the commission took a <A[communication|notification]> <A[about|over]> the common <M[<A[asylum|shelter]> procedure]> and that one union-wide valid homogeneous status of the acknowledged asylum-seekers at - that is the final aim of the common European <M[<A[asylum|shelter]> system]> defined in <U[Tampere]>.
Definitively I would like to express my respect for all the <A[work|job]> that was achieved by Ms <U[Ogata]> for the <U[UNHCR]> and gentlemen <U[Ruud Lubbers]> want everything good in <A[his|its]> new office.
It seems important for this restoration to us to <A[insist|push]> on a political amnesty, however, in Yugoslavia just as essential is according to our <A[opinion|view]>, that we the renewed <A[appearance|manner|occurrence]> of the infringements and terrorist activities at the <A[borders|boundaries]> between Serbia, Albania and Kosovo in all clearness to condemn because this reminds in alarming form of the incidents during the <M[Kosovo conflict]> in the case of which also western powers bore responsibility.
The digits 1, 2 and 3 of our <M[compromise resolution <A[request|application]>]> contain <A[unequivocal|unambiguous]> demands.
I appeal also to the gentleman president <U[Kostunica]>, to clear up what <U[Ukshin Hoti]>, whose fate we dealt with here repeated happened to people as gentlemen, and is nothing at all confessed to us by <A[his|its]> fate.
In the same way I can agree to the <A[appeal|muster]> to the <U[KFOR]>, to prevent further assaults in the <M[<U[Presevo]> valley]>.
I welcome the steps now introduced by the <U[KFOR]> to the overcoming of the problem and keep on asking to all <A[pages|sides]> emphatically, to to practice <U[derückhaltung]>.
B5-0916 / 2000 of Mr <U[Barón Crespo]> and other representatives in the name of the <M[<U[PSE]> <A[faction|fraction]>]>;
This <A[stipulation|clause]> was decided on in the March 1990 in the <M[<U[Moneda]>-palace]>. I know that there so exactly because I had the privilege during the <M[office takeover]> of president <U[Aylwin]> after the plebiscite that it put an end to the regime of general <U[Pinochet]> to be present.
Mr <U[Präsident]>, worth colleagues and colleagues! I would like to say something with regard to the resolution for which we will make <A[natural|unaffected]>.
Here the international community must exercise <A[their|her]> right to democratic control, not as interference into the <A[internal|inner]> matters of an independent country, but as political, <A[circumspect|prudent]> and preventive procedure.
The situation in the prisons and on the police guards, where maltreatment and torture are among other things at the agenda, is in every respect unacceptable.
