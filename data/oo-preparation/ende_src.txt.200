In %PRODUCTNAME you can assign hyperlinks to text ( see Hyperlink bar ) as well as to graphics and text frames ( see the Hyperlink tab page in the Graphic/Frames/Object dialog and the menu command Edit - ImageMap ). ImageMap
A Client Site ImageMap is analyzed on the destination computer , which loaded the graphic from the Internet , while Server Site ImageMap is analyzed on the computer which provides the HTML page in the Internet . In server analysis , clicking an ImageMap sends the position of the cursor within the picture or frame in relative coordinates to the server , and an extra program on the server must react accordingly .
The 32-bit plug-ins , which you have already installed in a version of Netscape already existing in your system , will be automatically recognized by %PRODUCTNAME from the registration data and offered in the file-open-dialog under <T1>File type</T1> .

If you format a document without Styles , it is referred to as " direct " formatting . This means modifying text or other objects , such as frames or tables , by applying various attributes directly .
On the other hand , for documents you want to make available to other computers , which may have a completely different directory structure , drive or volume names , it would make sense to save the references as relatives rather than as absolutes . SQL
Suppose you have a database table in text format , which you also want to open as a database table . In this case you would not only select the file , but also specify the file type " Text CVS " .

If you have opened multiple document windows with the <T1>New Window</T1> command , or used Drag &amp; Drop to copy one task to another , select the <T1>Tiled</T1> command for a tiled display in the task window .
<Tabelle1B>To use a template of your own which is not already located in the { installpath}/user/template { installpath}\user\template folder , you first have to import this template . To do this , open the</Tabelle1B> <T1>Template Management</T1> dialog , for example with <T1>File - Templates - Organize</T1> , and from the submenu of the <T1>Commands</T1> button select <T1>Import Template</T1> .
Double-click one of the documents shown or select and click the <T1>Open</T1> button to load this . <Tabelle5B>If you have selected more than one file ( Shift or Command Ctrl )held down ) in the</Tabelle5B> <T1>Open</T1> dialog , one click on <T1>Open</T1> will open them all together .
The filter in the category of other %PRODUCTNAME Calc filters loads the document in a %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet . This is useful , for example , in the case of stock market data available over the Internet in table form .
Click this button to insert the selected file at the cursor's position in the current document . ( If you opened the dialog with menu <T1>Insert - File</T1> you will notice that the <T1>Open</T1> button is called <T1>Insert</T1> ). Read-only
Upon opening a %PRODUCTNAME document a check is made that this is based on a template that is present in your { installpath}/share/template/german { installpath}\share\template\german folder or in { installpath}/user/template { installpath}\user\template ( including the subdirectories of these folders ; or in the folder that you have entered in Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - Paths as the template folder ) .
Depending on the application , you can , for example , view the number of words and characters in the text or the document's creation date . You can also enter and edit other document properties , for example , a title or key words that do not depend on the file name .
Statistical information about the current document is contained on the Statistics tab : the number of pages when printing , the number of tables used in the document , graphics and OLE objects , and the number of paragraphs , words and characters. and cells .
In terms of structure it corresponds to the <T1>Tools - Options - Text Document - Print</T1> <T1>register</T1> . This is where you set which information you do not wish to print out , how notes are to be treated during printing , which input slot is to be used , etc.
Under UNIX , the special characters 128 - 160 in Windows will appear in the printout . This makes it possible to take a document created in %PRODUCTNAME for Windows and possibly containing typographical characters , and print it on a PostScript printer under UNIX .
The sub-documents receive names derived from the master document . The first sub-document receives the same name as the master document with the serial number 1 at the end , but with the extension .sxw ( " Master1.sxw " ) .
In order to copy from %PRODUCTNAME to the clipboard you must , however , use the normal commands in %PRODUCTNAME ( short cut keys ( Ctrl)(C ) or the Copy icon on the function bar or in the menu Edit - Copy ).
To copy from another application simply select the text to be copied and then in %PRODUCTNAME start the command to paste from the clipboard ( shortcut keys ( Ctrl)(V ) or Paste icon on the function bar or in the menu Edit - Paste ).
This function performs a better search for matches and , therefore , differs from a search with regular expressions . For example , it can find words that differ from the search term by two characters , which can be either exchanged , deleted or inserted in a different position .
Enter here how many characters in the search term can be exchanged . For example , if you specify a maximum of 2 exchanged characters the words " black " and " crack " are considered similar .
If you confirm with " Yes , " all links will be automatically set to " invalid " ( #NV ) so that while the links are being checked ( which may take some time with slower servers ) you do not incorrectly assume a link has already been verified .
You may wish to break the link if you only want to work with the updated version of the linked file , or if the document is to be edited on another computer and the linked file can not be copied to the other computer .
<Tabelle1B>This function is at your disposal , when the cursor is in a text the cell is activated , when a change is marked or when ( after selecting a change entry ) you call the context menu in the</Tabelle1B> <T1>Accept or Reject Changes</T1> dialog and choose the command <T1>Edit Comment</T1> <T1>Change Comment</T1> .
If you now set the filtering criteria to see only the changes of author A , the deletion of author B also appears , because the original insertion by author A no longer corresponds to the current state of the document .
For the scaling of the dialogs (</Tabelle1B> <T1>Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - View</T1> ) however , the platforms use other mechanisms so that an 8-point font in a dialog may look different from an 8-point font in a document .
Page 1 of the dialog will only be visible when starting via the <T1>Insert - Object - Chart</T1> command ( or via the <T1>Insert chart</T1> ) icon ; pages 2 to 4 are identical to pages 1 to 3 in the corresponding dialog , that you receive with the chart selected via the <T1>Format - AutoFormat</T1> command .
This means that all attributes applied manually in addition to the Styles used , such as bold or italics will be removed from the current or selected paragraphs cells objects objects objects with the new format oriented on the Styles . If you write a new text in a paragraph , to which you have applied direct formats , and if you now want to continue writing without direct formats , press the ( Right arrow ) key once .
You can also define conditions yourself , in this case you can make the first section of hits dependent on the first condition , the second section dependent on the second condition and the third section will only be run if the first two conditions do not apply .
When opening documents made in an earlier version than %PRODUCTNAME Calc 5.0 ( in which nearly all two-digit years have the prefix 19 , except the last days of 1899 , see above ) , the old rule applies . Number Format Codes for Time Formats
For addition and subtraction of times , the value of the cell is displayed in a format according to the result . For example , this follows the pattern =End time - Start time or =(End time - Start time)*24*Hourly rate .
For the currency format the currency symbol that is available according to the locale setting is specified as the default , if you have selected <T1>Default</T1> as the language . The Euro currency can be entered with one of the following format codes :
0 " plus";0 " minus";0 " Null " Using this code , the cell values are displayed as rounded integers , with the text enclosed in quotation marks added as a suffix ( the text is displayed without quotation marks in the cell ) .
If you mark this field , the comma and period of the corresponding sentence characters will not be broken at the next line but - perhaps even over and beyond the right margin - come out in the same line .
Specify the <T1>Distance</T1> to the previous and following paragraph in this area.The first paragraph on the beginning of a page is always positioned without a distance to the top , the last paragraph at the end of a page does not have a distance to the bottom .
Once you have activated the register-true option for the current Page Style ( choose <T1>Format - Page - Page</T1> ) , click here to apply the option to the selected paragraphs ( direct formatting ) or the Paragraph Style .
<Tabelle2B>If you select an empty line in the preview , that is to say , if , of the three conditions " Line " , " Gray Line " and " No Line " , the condition " No Line " appears , this means that the relevant part of the border will be deleted .</Tabelle2B>
The position , size and for presentation objects font height on a master page will be redistributed in order to adapt to the new layout . It is therefore possible , for example , to reproduce a specific template layout on various page formats .
When the object is anchored to the page , paragraph , character or frame , it is aligned with the reference element such that the bottom of the object is aligned relative to the bottom of the reference element .
<Tabelle4B>If you have made the area invisible and you wish to undo this attribute , then not only do you have to assign it another area style ( such as a color ) , but you also have to select the corresponding color you want .
These layers rest directly on top of each other , one containing text and the others the graphics . All graphic objects in the graphic layer lie on top of each other , the first element at the bottom , and subsequent objects on top ; whereby the bottom elements are overlapped or hidden by other objects .
For example , if you draw a control first , then a rectangle that partially covers the control and click a part of the screen where both objects are , the rectangle will always be selected .</Tabelle1B> The order of the graphic objects within the graphic layer can be modified using the first four submenu commands , while the last two commands arrange the selected objects behind or in front of the text layer .
In contrast to the " as character " anchor , the object does not appear as a character in the text , but its horizontal and vertical position is determined by the position of the character it has been anchored to .
On the left of the window , a pointer points to the current record ; you can move this pointer with the up and down arrow keys , or with the buttons at the bottom of the window , or you can click a different record with the mouse .
This option represent the object in a manner that is its own : for example , a circle-like object and round area of an object through a circle-like projection , a square-like object and flat area through a flat projection .
<Tabelle8B>If you change the word in the</Tabelle8B> <T1>Word</T1> text box or replace it with a word from the <T1>Suggestions</T1> list box and then decide you want the original word back , click the word in the <T1>Original</T1> row and the original word reappears .
Click this button to replace the word in question every time it appears in the document with a word entered in the text box or selected from the <T1>Suggestions</T1> list . This will occur without further warning .
If you enter a line with the " Default " Paragraph Style that begins with a capital letter , but has no period at the end and is followed by two line breaks , the " Heading1 " Style will automatically be assigned .
Paragraphs starting with a dash ( - minus sign ) , a plus sign ( + ) or an asterik ( * ) and which are followed by a space o tab , will be replaced by the bullet character displayed in the dialog when subsequently using AutoFormat .
If you accept the suggestion , press the Enter key , space bar , arrow right key , or End key and then type the next word . %PRODUCTNAME automatically inserts spaces if you do not enter an end-of-sentence character .
When you define the values for the distance between text and text frame on the <T1>Position</T1> tab , the values for the indent of the paragraph on the <T1>Indent</T1> section of the <T1>Indents and spacing</T1> tab are adjusted accordingly .
If you define the distance between numbering icon and margin on the <T1>Position</T1> tab via the indent , the values for the paragraph indent in the <T1>Indent</T1> section of the <T1>Indents and spacing</T1> tab are added to it .
If you are importing older documents or are loading a %PRODUCTVERSION document into a %PRODUCTNAME version before 5.2 , the indents and spacing of the numbering will be incorporated unchanged so that no differences are visible . %PRODUCTNAME automatically adapts the settings in the paragraph dialog under <T1>Indents and Spacing</T1> and in the Outline Numbering dialog under <T1>Position</T1> to the respective version accordingly .
If no left paragraph indent has been set on the Indents and Spacing tab page ( from left = 0 cm ) , the indentation will appear with the distance between the left page border and the numbering symbol .
<Tabelle1B>If you do not see the toolbar to be edited , close the</Tabelle1B> <T1>Configuration</T1> dialog , load a document or open an empty document in which you can see the toolbar , and then access the <T1>Configuration</T1> dialog again .
To conclude typing , click anywhere outside the border . ( The behavior when double-clicking is influenced by your selection under</Tabelle12B> <T1>Tools - Options - Presentation -</T1> <T1>General</T1> , <T1>Allow quick editing</T1> and <T1>Text area only selectable</T1> . )
At the same time %PRODUCTNAME analyzes the three properties ; " database " , " data source " and " type of data source " so that it can be inserted in the correct position in the logical form structure of the target document . A control , which shows contents from the address book , for example , will show address book contents after it has been copied into the target document .
When you drag a group frame over already existing controls and subsequently want to select a control , you have to first open the context menu of the group frame and choose <T1>Arrange Order - Send to Back</T1> .
If the formatted field is connected to a field of the database that can be displayed as a number , the input is treated as numbers . ( The date and time are also handled internally as numbers ) .
In the case of label fields , the alignment option refers to the title of the field , in the case of text fields to their content , and in the case of columns of a table control to the content of the table fields ( data ) .
The text of the label field is inserted everywhere , where the name of a source database field should be , that is , for example , in the Filter Navigator , Search dialog and as a column name in the table view .
If you assign no reference value , " ON " is sent for every activated control ; if the two fields " feminine " and " masculine " are grouped , " ON " is transmitted for the group if one of the fields was clicked .
If you have a set of three options , for example " in progress " , " completed " , and " resubmission " , with the respective reference values , " ToDo " , " OK " , and " RS " , these reference values appear in the database if the respective option is clicked .
For combo boxes , the field of the current form table in which the values entered or selected by the user should be stored is specified under <T1>Data Field</T1> . ( The values displayed in the list of the combo box are based on an SQL statement which is entered under <T1>List Contents</T1> . )
If you want a list field to display data from a table that is linked to the current form table , specify the field of the form table that the file content of the list field refers to or the database field that controls the display of the data in the form under <T1>Data Field</T1> .
For text fields , the visible entries are transmitted ; for list boxes , the selected entries are transmitted ; for check boxes and option fields , the associated reference values are transmitted if these fields were activated .
This means , for example , you can issue a " confirm deletion " request such as " Really delete customer xyz ? " when deleting a data record . In the following , all events defined for a form that can be linked to a macro are described :
<Tabelle2B>If the form is based on an SQL statement ( see</Tabelle2B> <T1>Data Source</T1> property ) the filter and sort functions are available only if the SQL statement refers to a table and is not written in the database's native SQL .
Forms that have been assigned to a database , that is to say that have been created in the form container of the database by using the command <T1>New - Form</T1> , will always belong to that database .
If you want the form to refer to a query , you first have to select the option " Query " as data source type , so that you can specify a query as the data source .
For example , if you want all registers of a data base to be sorted on one field in an ascending order and on other field in a descending order , enter ( Name of field 1 ) ASC , ( Name of field 2 ) DESC .
The database table on which the form is based is , for example , a customer database ( " Customer " ) , where every customer has been given a unique number in a data field named " Cust_ID " .
Alternatively , you can use a field called " Cust_ID " ; to make sure that this field is not confused with the field from the main form ( which we will assume is called " Customer_ID " ) .
If , for example , you specified the " CustomerID " database field as a parent field under <T1>Link master fields</T1> , then you can define under <T1>Link slave fields</T1> the name of the variable in which the values of the " CustomerID " database field are to be read .
They display the data in a graphical fashion and can be used to enter new data or change existing data which is then stored in the database table or query used as the basis of the form .
Should you require a form , which not simply refers to the data in a table or query but which is also to display data in another table , then you can create a subform in your form .
Normally you can copy controls in the document view through the clipboard ( shortcut keys ( command ) ( Ctrl ) ( C ) for copying and ( command ) ( Ctrl ) ( V ) for inserting ) .
Thus the <T1>List Box AutoPilot</T1> allows two tables of a database to be linked , so that the control field can display a detailed list of a database field that is located in a different table from the one to which the form refers .
If an article table contains , for example , the number of a supplier , the list box can use the ' supplier number ' link to display the name of the supplier from the supplier table . On the <T1>Field links</T1> page the AutoPilot will ask you about all the settings required for this link .
The user values entered in the combination field or selected in the list can be saved in the database table which is accessed in the form . ( The saving of values in another table is not possible. ) If the values are not to be saved in a database , they will be saved only in the form .
<Tabelle2B>If there is an error message , when you start %PRODUCTNAME , that states that certain fonts have not been found , you can still install them with Setup in the Repair mode if it is a %PRODUCTNAME font .
If you click the <T1>Reduce indent</T1> icon while holding down the Command key ( Ctrl ) key , the indent for the selected paragraph is moved by the default tab stop that has been set under <T1>Tools - Options - Text Document - General</T1> .
Click the <T1>Increase Indent</T1> icon while holding down the Command key Ctrl key to move over the indenting of the selected paragraph by the default tab distance set under <T1>Tools - Options - Text Document - General</T1> .
Click this icon to open the Borders floating toolbar , where you modify the border of a sheet area an object . This may , for example , be a border of a text frame , a graphic or a table .
This may , for example , be a border of a frame , a graphic or a table . The icon on the object bar will only be visible if a graphic , a table , a chart object or a frame has been selected .
If you want to load a new document with a similar URL to that of the current document , simply edit the URL entry in the combo box and press Enter . %PRODUCTNAME helps you by recognizing similar entries as you type and making appropriate suggestions , so that often you only need type parts of the URL .
Click this icon to insert a hyperlink from the current URL into your document . The URL is taken from the collection box for Internet URLs , the name is taken from the URL Name combo box .
This dialog is also opened when you insert data from a database by drag and drop from the data source browser into the document , because you first have to state in the dialog whether the data should be inserted as a table , as fields or as text .
If at the same time you selected a special field within the filtered records , when you open the Filter dialog this additional selection will be correctly displayed by an AND operator . %PRODUCTNAME interprets your selection according to the logic " filtered records " AND " selection " , since you looked for a record within the filtered records .
If you sort the field name " First name " in ascending order and the field name " last name " in descending order , all records will be sorted in ascending order by first name , and then within the first names , in descending order by last name .
If the cursor is in a field containing simple text ( without tabs and line breaks ) when the dialog is called up , the selected entry will be automatically entered into the text box of the Find dialog .
If the <T1>Apply field format</T1> check box is marked , the data view of the table or form is searched using the formatting set there ; if it is not marked , the database is searched using the formatting saved in the database . Example :
Dividing the view between form and table is also available if you have created your own form based on text , spreadsheet or presentation documents by using the <T1>Form Functions</T1> floating toolbar . If this should be the case you will see each group of option fields , for example , as a pull-down list in the table view of your form .
If you split the page into columns or the cursor is placed in multiple-column text frame , you can freely change the column width and the column spacing on the ruler by dragging it with the mouse .
<Tabelle3B>In order to change the left indent starting only with the second line of a paragraph , hold down the ( Command ) ( Ctrl ) key , click the triangle on the bottom left , and drag it to the right while holding the key .</Tabelle3B>
You can release individual objects from the group by holding down the <T1>( Command )</T1> <T1>( Ctrl )</T1> key and clicking them with the mouse without actually using the respective menu command to enter this group and edit its individual elements .
You can release individual objects from the group by holding down the <T1>( Command )</T1> <T1>( Ctrl )</T1> key and clicking them with the mouse without actually using the respective menu command to enter this group and edit its individual elements .
When selecting files , objects , text passages and cells , rows and columns in tables , the modifier keys enhance , among other things , the selection - the functions are explained accordingly in the descriptions of the individual options .
The shortcut keys that you can use instead of the menu commands are shown on the right hand side of the menu lists next to the corresponding menu command . ( Not all of the mentioned keys for controlling dialogs are available on the Macintosh. )
There are several ways to find what you are looking for in the Help environment : You can search for a specific keyword in the Index , carry out a full-text search under Find , or look through a hierarchical list of the Topics .
Rest the cursor for a moment on an icon to see the name of that icon appear . The tip function also provides valuable help in many places , such as the names of chapters when scrolling through a long document .
This assumes that all graphics were inserted as links , and that you had already converted all graphics into GIF or JPG format . In fact , %PRODUCTNAME can automatically convert embedded graphics to GIF files and insert their corresponding tags into HTML pages , but you have no control over the file names .
For example , you can open a PCX file and then save the images in JPG format in your homepage directory . Integrated graphics in other formats would be converted into JPG format by %PRODUCTNAME automatically when exported as HTML documents and are often given meaningless names .
Within the dialog , you can modify your entries and options at any time . You may also skip an entire page or even all the AutoPilot pages , in which case the current ( or default ) settings will remain in effect .
According to your selections , the AutoPilot creates a new document template and saves it on your hard disk. %PRODUCTNAME creates a new document based on the existing templates with the " Untitled X " name ( X stands for the consecutive numbering ) and displays it on the work area .
If your printer supports this function , you can define separate printer trays for the first page and subsequent pages of your document . This enables you , for instance , to print the first page on company letterhead , and use normal paper for the following pages .
Within the dialog you can modify your entries and options at any time . You may also skip an entire page or even all the AutoPilot pages , in which case the current ( or default ) settings will remain in effect .
According to your selections , the AutoPilot creates a document template and saves it on your hard disk . A new document based on the template appears in the work area , with the filename " UntitledX " ( X stands for each document ) .

A default HTML presentation is created here as a so-called Kiosk export , in which the slides are automatically advanced after the time which you have defined as the slide view time , or after a time that is the same for all slides .
So do not delete the dbf file !</Tabelle2B> If the selected *.sdb file contains queries or forms , these will , provided you specify this in the AutoPilot , be read from the *.sdb file and created as new documents in a directory of your choice .
Queries are special views of tables , which can , for example , display certain records or only a few fields per record and if required also sort those records . A query can be for one table as well as for multiple tables , if they are linked by common data fields .
To do this , click a field name in a table ( for example , the field name " Item-Number " from the Customer table ) , hold down the mouse button and then drag the field name to the field name of the other table ( " Item-Number " from the Item table ) .
You can use drag and drop to copy a query from %PRODUCTNAME , but you can just as easily do the same with a table from a %PRODUCTNAME Writer or HTML document or a marked part of this , or a cell range from a %PRODUCTNAME Calc spreadsheet .
<Tabelle1B>If the fields of the target table have a smaller field length as in the source table when data is being annexed , adjust the field contents of the copied table to the length of the fields in the target table .</Tabelle1B> Creating Primary Keys
If you check this box , a primary key field is automatically generated and filled with values . You should use this field if , for example , you copy a dBase table to the Adabas format , since in the Adabas format a primary key must always be available in order to edit the table .
When you , as administrator , create a database table , you can use this register to determine if and to what extent the user has access to this table and can manipulate the data or table structure .
This dialog can be started by choosing File - Template - Address Book Source ; apart from this , it starts automatically when you access one of our templates for the first time and this assignment has not yet taken place .
In a dialog , from <T1>Tools - Data Sources</T1> , you can specify the data source , give it a name by which it is addressed in %PRODUCTNAME and , depending on the type selected , specify various options .
You can choose among a semicolon ( ; ) , comma ( , ) , colon ( : ) , tab , space , or another character , which you can enter in the respective combo box .
The command entered does not lead to the display of filtered database content , the dialog is used only for input of administration commands such as Grant , Create Table , Drop Table , and so on .
In your documents , irrespective of whether you create a link or not , by using the Field commands Field commands and/or Form functions you can also make reference to the current contents in each case of the data fields of a data source .
For example , to create a new form for a database on a network drive , %PRODUCTNAME can set this up for the database only if there is no database with the same name on your local hard drive .</Tabelle2B>
You can , for example in the original path , load and see the themes on the company server but not inadvertently change these , and in the additional path you can create , edit and delete your own themes .
When you enter text , %PRODUCTNAME automatically recognizes a word that may be a URL and replaces the word with a hyperlink . %PRODUCTNAME formats the hyperlink with direct font attributes ( color and underline ) the properties of which are obtained from certain Character Styles .
The button allows you to choose whether the docked window should be " squashed " when the current document is shown , so that both can be shown together , or whether the document underneath it should be covered over temporarily .</Tabelle1B>
You can check this by loading the document and choosing <T1>File - Document Template - Organizer</T1> then double-clicking the document . As soon as you load or open this document , the configuration saved therein becomes active .
If you want to copy a simple , rectangular area of cells into a text document as a sheet , select the cells in the sheet and then use either the clipboard or drag &amp; drop to insert them into the text document .
If you want to exchange data with a database which does not have an ODBC link and which does not allow dBase import and export , it is often possible to exchange the data via a common text format .
If you save the current document with <T1>File - Save</T1> or ( Ctrl)(S ) , under the path and file name from which you opened it , the old version will be overwritten by the new version .
You can also enter a URL in the <T1>File name</T1> text box of the <T1>Open</T1> dialog , but this must start with the fully extended form with file : / / / or ftp : / / or http : / / .
If you make a mistake during drag and drop and want to reverse the function , position the cursor in your document and choose the Undo command from the <T1>Edit</T1> menu ( or via the keyboard ) .
If you move it ( drag it without pressing any key , in which case no additional symbol appears next to the mouse pointer ) , only the font attributes are copied from the graphic and applied to the draw object on which you release the mouse button .
If you copy it ( drag it while holding down the ( Ctrl ) key , in which case a plus sign appears next to the mouse pointer ) , the graphic will be inserted as an object .
If you create a hyperlink ( drag while holding down ( Shift ) and ( Ctrl ) , in which case a linking arrow appears next to the mouse pointer ) , the drawing object is replaced by the graphic from the Gallery , but the position and size of the replaced draw object are retained .
Once the graphic is selected , release the mouse button . Click again on the graphic image , keeping the mouse button pressed for more than two seconds , to copy the graphic image to an internal memory .
If you want to copy an icon , say from an object bar to the function bar , so that it is always visible , simply hold down the ( Alt ) key and drag the icon to its new location . %PRODUCTNAME automatically remembers the configuration of the toolbars .
You now have a choice : Either click the icon that you want to activate , or seize the floating toolbar by its title bar and drag it away from the main toolbar while holding down the mouse button ( You first have to release the mouse button , otherwise you cannot seize the title bar with the mouse ) .
If you now click the <T1>Insert</T1> Graphics icon , you will see that icon at the top of the main toolbar instead . A short click opens the directly visible function , whereas a longer click opens the floating toolbar again .
When you include hyperlinks , ( at least ) two factors must be taken into account , namely whether they are set as relative or absolute on saving , and whether or not the file is present :
Neither a server nor a computer of a reader needs to have a C : hard drive : ( operating systems such as Unix or MacOS do not recognize drive letters ) and even if the folder homepage\grahics existed your picture would not be available . It is better to use relative addressing for file links .
If the <T1>Link</T1> box is marked , whenever the document is updated and loaded the bitmap image is reloaded , and the editing steps , that you have carried out in the local copy of the image in the document , are re-applied and the image is displayed .
On the <T1>Format</T1> tab you can define your own label formats , not covered by the predefined formats . To be able to do this , the label type on the <T1>Labels</T1> tab must be set to " User-defined " .
The language you select for your document specifies , amongst other things , the dictionary to be used for spellcheck , thesaurus and hyphenation , the decimal and thousands separator to be used and the default currency format .
On the <T1>Navigation</T1> floating toolbar you first select the category then click on one of the buttons to the right - <T1>Previous Object</T1> or <T1>Next Object</T1> . The names of the buttons refer to the category , for example , the button for scrolling is named depending on the " Next Page " or " Next Bookmark " category .
For simplicity's sake , all contents of the Navigator window are referred to here as " categories , " whether titles , sheets , tables , text frames , graphics , OLE objects , sections , hyperlinks , references , indexes or notes .
<Tabelle2B>If the cursor is located within a section with numbering or bullets , you can turn off automatic numbers or bullets for the current paragraph or selected paragraphs by clicking the</Tabelle2B> <T1>Number List On/Off</T1> icon on the Object Bar .
Under <T1>Margins</T1> you can define the maximum or minimum possible value for the page margins ( left , right , top , and bottom ) by pressing the ( Page Up ) or ( Page Down ) keys .
If the list of changes is too long , you can switch to the <T1>Filter</T1> tab in the dialog and specify that you only want to see the changes of certain authors , or only the changes of the last day , or that you want the list to be restricted in some other way .
You can now accept the " insertions " , in which case the relevant texts stay in their original form , or you can accept the " deletions " , in which case the marked text contained in the copy are not inserted in your document .
Not all changes are recorded ( for example , the changing of a tab stop from align left to align right is not recorded ) . However , all usual changes made by a proofreader are recorded , such as additions , deletions , text alterations , usual formatting etc.
<Tabelle2B>If you move to a marked change with the mouse pointer , you will see a reference to the type of change , the author , date and time of day for the change in the Help Tip .
When several authors are working on the same text or spreadsheet , the review function ( marking changes , redlining ) makes it possible to document who made which changes , so that this is clear to everyone .
For this purpose , you normally have to enter a sequence of control characters and the desired fax number in the first line of the document ; please consult the please documentation of your fax software for help .
If you are in possession of a PostScript-enabled printer , you must always install a description file that adapts the printer ( PostScript Printer Definition - PPD ) so that you can utilize the paper tray selection , the duplex print function ( if the printer has it ) and any built-in fonts .
Therefore , only those fonts will be shown in the font selection box when working with a text document which can also be printed , as it is assumed that you will only want to use those fonts that you can actually have printed on paper .
If you want to change the settings of your default tab stops , you will find further information under Tools - Options - Text Document - General Tools - Options - Spreadsheet - General Tools - Options - Drawing - General Tools - Options - Presentation - General .
To open a file from the same folder of a currently opened file , which has only a slightly different name , you can quickly select this new file using the <T1>URL</T1> field in the Function bar .
This status shows that the icon cannot be activated . For example , if a graphics object has been selected , the icon for inserting a table cannot be used since it is not logical to insert a table in a graphic .
You can also move points as in the move mode : If , however , you click at the curve between two points and move the mouse a little while holding down the mouse button you insert a new point .
If you convert a curve or a polygon with the <T1>To curve</T1> icon into a straight line or you change a curve with the mouse so that this point lies on the straight line , it is removed .
You can set the angle from which the point reduction is to take place by choosing <T1>Tools - Options - Drawing - Grid</T1> . by choosing <T1>Tools - Options - Presentation - Grid</T1> . is 15° by default .
This section contains information about connecting external data sources to %PRODUCTNAME , including a general introduction to the %PRODUCTNAME database concept . You will also find instructions on how to set up new data sources , how to edit existing data sources , the use of external data sources as address books when creating form letters , creating and editing database tables and queries , creating forms and linking documents with data sources .
You can use a number of variables : $ ( inst ) stands for the path of the directory in which %PRODUCTNAME was installed. $ ( user ) stands for the path where the user installed his or her %PRODUCTNAME files during the user-defined installation .
The user has installed in his Home directory on his hard disk and the directory created for the %PRODUCTNAME files will be called { userinstall } in the following . Entries in the paths list box which indicate more than one path
In the right color window , you will see the entire color spectrum from the left to the right , with the colors at the top being fully saturated and the colors at the bottom being unsaturated .
If you have not opened the Help Agent for a particular situation three times in succession , but have closed it or let it close automatically , the Help Agent for this situation will not be shown again .
Since almost all default Paragraph Styles are based on the <T1>Standard</T1> Paragraph Style , in doing this you define a font for nearly all predifined Paragraph Styles in the text area , unless the Paragraph Style explicitly defines another font .
If you have a printer that only has single-sided printing capability , then you can achieve this effect by first printing out all the fronts with the <T1>Right pages</T1> option marked , then re-inserting the entire paper stack in your printer and printing all the backs with the <T1>Left pages</T1> option marked .
If this field is not checked then it may occur that the first page of the second copy is printed on the reverse side of the last page of the first copy , especially if there is an odd page number .
If this field is marked , centered and right-aligned paragraphs containing tabs are formatted as a whole in the center or aligned to the right . If this field is not marked , only the text to the right of the last tab , for example , is aligned to the right , while the text to the left remains where it is .
You will find various options for defining the contents to be displayed on the screen or to be printed , how to scroll the screen pages , how to highlight keywords in the source text and much more .
Select this option to automatically apply the formatting attributes of the selected cell to the empty adjacent cells . If , for example , the contents of the selected cell have the bold attribute , this bold attribute will also apply to adjacent cells .
In the case of an opened presentation or drawing document , contour mode can also be activated from the Options Bar with the <T1>Object Outline ( No Fill )</T1> <T1>Object Outline ( No Fill )</T1> <T1>Object Outline ( No Fill )</T1> icon .
If you have activated the snap grid but wish to move or create individual objects without snap positions , keep the ( command ) ( Ctrl ) key pressed to deactivate this function for as long as needed .
You can also define this setting by using the <T1>Snap to Snap Lines</T1> <T1>Snap to Snap Lines</T1> <T1>Snap to Snap Lines</T1> icon , which is available in the Options Bar in an opened presentation or drawing document .
In order to avoid making " jumps " that go too far when you position and create graphic objects , you should increase the default value snap range only in small increments of about 5 to 10 pixels ( matrix dots ) .
This way , you can adjust the rulers to the size of the objects that you draw on the page so that you can check the distances on the page in the current units . Enter a measure of 1:50 , for example , if you want to draw a ground plan of your living room .
When saving in another format than Microsoft Format , the Microsoft Basic Code is not saved . If the document contains Microsoft Basic Code and you save it in %PRODUCTNAME format , for example , you will be warned that the Microsoft Basic Code will not be saved .
Mark the box in the [ L ] column in front of the entry if a Microsoft OLE object is to be converted into the specified %PRODUCTNAME OLE object when a Microsoft document is loaded into %PRODUCTNAME .
Mark the box in the [ S ] column in front of the entry if a %PRODUCTNAME OLE object is to be converted into the specified Microsoft OLE object when a document is saved in a Microsoft file format .
In the dialog which appears when you choose <T1>Format -</T1> <T1>Asian Typography</T1> you can specify for the paragraph or Paragraph Style whether the list of forbidden characters applies to those at the beginning or end of a line in a paragraph .
If you have specified a country in your system settings where decimal points in numbers are represented by a comma , and thousand separators are represented by a point , this setting also applies to calculations in %PRODUCTNAME Basic .
Measurement units The pass parameters of a method , which contain the measurement unit information , can be set in %PRODUCTNAME Basic either as an integer or long integer expression without a defined unit , or as a character string with a defined unit .
If such a parameter is passed as an integer or long integer expression , the default unit defined for the active document type in the <T1>Layout</T1> tab under <T1>Tools - Options</T1> will be used as the measurement unit .
In %PRODUCTNAME you can also enter the path for your files with the backslash " \ " as the separator ; the application will convert it to the correct URL convention with a slash " / " .
Since the colon ( used by many operating systems to separate the disk drive letter from the next part of the address ) already has a different function in a URL address , convention dictates that it is replaced by a vertical line " | " here .
After you have broke down your program into procedures and functions ( Subs and Functions ) , you may want to save matching procedures and functions as files , so you can use them in other projects . %PRODUCTNAME Basic supports this by using Modules and Libraries .
Here you will find which variable types are supported by %PRODUCTNAME Basic and the value range for certain variables , as well as a description of tools such as Modules and Libraries used to structure your %PRODUCTNAME programs .
Numbers can also be used in a variable name , but punctuation symbols and special characters are not permitted , with exception of the underscore character ( " _ " ) . %PRODUCTNAME Basic does not distinguish between upper and lower-case letters .
As soon as the variable has been declared , it is automatically set to the " Null " value , i.e. , you do not need to manually reset a declared variable to a zero-value . Note the following conventions :
An advantage of SUBS and FUNCTIONS is that once you have developed a program code containing task components , you can use this code in different places in your project , but also in all future projects .
You will discover how you can organize modules or libraries , which functions are available to you in the Basic Editor , and how the IDE can help you find errors in your programs ( debugging ) .
Using the Library List Box in the %PRODUCTNAME Basic Toolbar In the <T1>Library</T1> list box at the left of the toolbar , you can click on any entry to switch to the first module of a corresponding library .
Therefore , if you have developed a program with multiple SUBS and FUNCTIONS that call each other , make sure you copy all necessary elements in order for your program to run in another document or template .</Tabelle4B>
<Tabelle2B>...immediately before a document is saved under a specified name ( with</Tabelle2B> <T1>File - Save As</T1> , or with <T1>File - Save</T1> or the <T1>Save</T1> icon , if a document name has not yet been specified ) .
<Tabelle2B>...directly after a document is saved under a specified name ( with</Tabelle2B> <T1>File - Save As</T1> , or with <T1>File - Save</T1> or with the <T1>Save</T1> icon , if a document name has not yet been specified ) .
In any %PRODUCTNAME application you can assign a macro ( as well as any %PRODUCTNAME Basic project ) to certain toolbars , define a key combination to execute a macro , or start a macro with a pull-down menu entry .
By using a breakpoint , you can interrupt a program just before an error occurs to then run the program in the Single Step mode ( row-wise ) until the error occurs . Using the Watch icon , you can also check the content of the relevant variables .
MsgBox Text As String [ ,Type As Integer [ ,Dialogtitle As String ] ] ( As Statement ) or MsgBox ( Text As String [ ,Type As Integer [ ,Dialogtitle As String ] ] ) ( As Function )
Append ( append to sequential file ) , binary ( data can be accessed by bytes using Get and Put ) , Input ( opens data channel for reading ) , Output ( opens data channel for writing ) , and Random ( edits relative files ) .
Shared ( file may be opened by other applications ) , Lock Read ( file is protected against reading ) , Lock Write ( file is protected against writing ) , Lock Read Write ( denies file access ) .
If the contents of this variable do not match the length of a record specified in the <T1>Len</T1> clause of the <T1>Open</T1> statement , the space from the end of the new written data to the next record is padded with the existing data in the file .
If no drive is specified or if the drive is a zero-length string ( " " ) , CurDir returns the path for the current drive . %PRODUCTNAME Basic reports an error if the syntax of the drive description is incorrect or a drive is defined which either does not exist or is found after the drive defined in the CONFIG.SYS with the Lastdrive statement .
This enables date and time values to be combined by simple addition to a single floating-decimal number . %PRODUCTNAME Basic supports the variable type Date , which can contain a time specification consisting of both a date and time .</Tabelle1B>
If you use the Imp operator in bit expressions , a bit will be deleted from the result if the corresponding bit is set in the first expression and the corresponding bit is deleted in the second expression .
If the format code contains at least one digit placeholder ( 0 or # ) to the right of the symbol E- , E+ , e- , or e+ , the number is formatted in the scientific or exponential format .
Characters that must be preceded by a backslash in the format code in order to be displayed as literal characters are the date- and time-formatting characters ( a , c , d , h , m , n , p , q , s , t , w , y , / , : ) , numeric-formatting characters ( # , 0 , % , E , e , comma , period ) and string-formatting characters ( @ , &amp; , &lt; , &gt; , ! ) .
In the dialog editor , create the following controls : a <T1>check box</T1> with the name <T1>CheckBox1</T1> , a <T1>label field</T1> with the name <T1>Label1</T1> , a <T1>button</T1> with the name <T1>CommandButton1</T1> , and a <T1>list box</T1> with the name <T1>ListBox1</T1> .
The records are treated as a sample of data , we want to make a statement about all children based on " our " children ( a representative result cannot e obtained from a sample popuplation of less than one thousand ) .
WORKDAY , YEARFRAC , DATE , DATEVALUE , EDATE , TODAY , YEAR , NOW , WEEKNUM , WEEKNUM_ADD , MINUTE , MONTH , EOMONTH , NETWORKDAYS , EASTERSUNDAY , SECOND , HOUR , DAY , DAYS , DAYS360 , WEEKDAY , TIME and TIMEVALUE .
The default format of a cell containing the DATE function is the date format , but you can format the cells with the <T1>0</T1> number format , for example , which displays the internal serial number of the date as a number .
